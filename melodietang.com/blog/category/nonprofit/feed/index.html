<strong>Organization description</strong>: Recognized by President Obama <wbr />as one of the best new ideas for social innovation, Moneythink expands economic opportunity in the United States by equipping low-income youth to navigate the financial decisions of adulthood.

<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ted-Gonder-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-751 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ted-Gonder-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Ted Gonder, Moneythink" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ted Gonder, <a href="http://moneythink.org/">Moneythink</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://thedodus.com/"> Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Ted Gonder is a social entrepreneur, a mentor, an optimist for change, and the founder of <a href="http://moneythink.org/">Moneythink</a> &#8211; an organization that is restoring the economic health of the United States through preventative, transformative, and evidence-driven youth financial education. Moneythink is headquartered in Chicago because “if you’re going to solve an education problem anywhere in the US, Chicago is the place to do it.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the power of mentorship</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When I was 14, I had a math tutor who really helped set me straight and aspire to greater heights. From him and other mentors, I learned to think about my life like an entrepreneurial venture and my decisions like each was an investment in my future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a mentor has been a core part of who I am because I think the way to pay it forward is to do for others for what was done for you.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On blending approaches and tactics to bring change</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted believes that Moneythink’s approach is unique because it is taking the best of various methods to build a more complete and impactful financial literacy approach that has never existed before.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Moneythink is tackling the issue of youth financial capability unlike anybody else. Financial education is nearly a billion dollar industry, but the industry as a whole has very little to show for it. What we’ve done is premise our entire approach on high-touch, high-tech, blended-learning interventions. We are taking the age-old proven method of mentorship to transform youth trajectories, and infusing it with cutting edge technology to get better data, to reach students outside of the classroom, and to deepen the relationship between the mentor and pupil. Nobody else is doing that.  Everyone is either doing volunteer programs or relying entirely on technology as a way to reach students. No one else is saying that maybe the right solution is blending the old and the new.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Financial education is nearly a billion dollar industry, but the industry as a whole has very little to show for it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Most people say that education technology helps you reach more kids. We know many of our kids are not self-directed learners yet. Rather than just expecting them to engage with an app, we weave technology into an existing mentor program.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building financial literacy into education curriculum</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted sat on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/26/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans</a> where he had a front row seat into the federal discussion, and an opportunity to represent the needs of younger generations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The unfortunate reality is that financial capability is not viewed as a critical component of a young person’s education in terms of what makes our nation more competitive. This is partially because financial literacy programs to date have been too fragmented in their approach so there is not substantive data that says financial skill-building interventions have hard economic implications on a student’s upward mobility, debt levels, and anything else that a government ultimately cares about. When you try to make the education argument for financial literacy you’re competing with math and science standards, and without adequate proof it&#8217;s hard to justify even slight reductions in time spent on those standards. That’s another reason that we see our role as so completely necessary &#8211; this industry needs some serious upending.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;This industry needs some serious upending.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">On the topic of actually making financial literacy more engaging to youth, Ted says that the program tries to weave otherwise boring financial topics into examples that youth can relate to, such as celebrities. For example, talking about Wesley Snipes evading taxes or the Kardashians&#8217; credit card habits. “It completely changed the student experience. If you meet people where they are and then bring finance into something that relates to what they&#8217;re interested in,  and the way they think and perceive the world; then you can make a big impact into somebody’s thinking.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On winning the White House Champions of Change award and social media</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2012, Moneythink was called by the White House as one of the finalists for the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/champions" target="_blank">White House Champions of Change</a>. “That was the moment where it really become clear that this was a national movement.”</p>
<p>In order to win, the Moneythink team had one week to get the most votes. “If you study people who have successfully built loyal online followings, they say social media is just a tool but what really matters are the relationships you build to help you get your message out. What helped us win the White House competition and rally so many votes wasn&#8217;t that we had a ton of Facebook likes or Twitter followers to begin with, but that we had built a massive allegiance of enthusiastic, college-aged, hyper-connected leaders and we leaned on all of them to drive traffic to this voting page. We’d built a network and kept them updated personally &#8211; not just through social media. That’s what gave us something to tap into that was real. I think it’s easy to mistake social media for something that is inherently substantive, but it’s not. The relationships that you build in real life matter so much more.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it’s easy to mistake social media for something that is inherently substantive, but it’s not. The relationships that you build in real life matter so much more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On measuring change</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our three core metrics are: 1) Are our students saving more regularly? 2) Are our students spending more mindfully? 3) Are our students making wiser safer financial product choices as they enter adulthood?&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are in the midst of a three year longitudinal study funded by <a href="http://www.spentmovie.com/mobilizing-clarksdale.html">American Express</a> in Clarksdale, Mississippi. We are tracking 11th and 12th graders through the program and after the program ends. The first year’s results were just released and are very encouraging. We hope that we can begin creating benchmarks that we can hold the rest of the industry to.”</p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">To condense it all into one Tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/tedgonder" target="_blank">@tedgonder</a> offers, “Dream big. Start small. Save today. Spend mindfully. Watch where you step. Most of all, find a mentor and stick to your guns.” You can read more on Ted’s philosophies on <a href="http://www.tedgonder.com/#blog" target="_blank">his blog</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Rose Afriyie, Genevieve Nielsen, Marina Goldshteyn<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Technology that simplifies the screening process for public assistance programs.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://www.mrelief.com/">http://www.mrelief.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/mrelief_form">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Interview Date</strong>: July 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_711" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/portrait-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-711" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/portrait-4-300x288.jpg" alt="Rose Afriyie, mRelief" width="300" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rose Afriyie, <a href="http://mrelief.com/">mRelief</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Rose Afriyie is a founder, a technologist, an activist, a writer. She is part of an all-women trio of co-founders that met and joined forces at the<a href="http://www.starterleague.com/"> Starter League</a> to start<a href="http://www.mrelief.com/"> mRelief</a>, a company whose mission is to “fix the broken American welfare system that leaves vulnerable people without access to available public assistance.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On simplifying the process</span></strong><strong>:</strong><br />
One of the biggest barriers in the welfare application process is how much time it takes. Rose used to carry around the standard food stamps application to help drive this point home to people who had not seen it before &#8211; “It’s 18 pages long.”</p>
<p>mRelief currently focuses on simplifying the qualifying process. They start with a global screening form on the first page of their website that is only 5 questions long, and currently screens for<a href="http://www.mrelief.com/programs"> 8 different programs</a> at once. When mRelief partnered with the King Community Center to pilot their screening process, the results showed that they reduced the assisted application time from an average of 16 minutes to 4 minutes, a 75% decrease. Using this simplified screening process as an entry point, can result in huge time savings for applicants who don’t have that much time. “Almost 3/4 of American who are on a public benefits program are members of working families,” and many of the welfare offices are only open during standard working hours.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On increasing discovery and awareness</span></strong>:<br />
In addition to improving the application process in itself, “mRelief is advancing and increasing transparency, visibility and awareness around the assistance criteria. We’re trying to create awareness about what solves your problem. There may be a local resource, but you just don’t know about it. You might just need food for that week or month, and the<a href="http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/site/PageServer"> Chicago Food Depository</a> has multiple food pantry sites all over the city. If you already know that you’re ineligible for food stamps, finding the closest food pantry might be a better use of your time.” The website offers food pantry referrals through a partnership with <a href="http://purplebinder.com/">Purple Binder</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On extending reach and sustaining impact</span></strong><strong>:</strong><br />
The mRelief screening can be done via the website or text message. “For many low income families there may not be a computer at home, and not everyone has the same literacy to do research on government eligibility. Thinking through how to replicate the paper and web forms via text messaging has benefitted lower income families. People using the text messaging service make an average of $150 less per hour than the people we are reaching online.”</p>
<p>In addition to developing the technology itself, mRelief focuses on building the right partnerships to make an impact within the welfare network. They have integrated with community centers that are run by the<a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss/supp_info/community_servicecenterlocations.html"> Department of Family and Support Services</a>, such as the King, Garfield and North Area community centers in Chicago; and partnered with Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s<a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/#overview"> Innovation Delivery Team</a> to launch the pilot last year.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s not enough to have a one app wonder. You have to build an institution, a network of people who are willing to look ahead at where this is going to be for folks in the future. When I think of innovation, I think of institutions that have been built that can lead to more long-term changes.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On her journey</span></strong>:<br />
“This was something that I think was lurking around in the background without me noticing it. In my own personal life, I’m the product of public assistance programs. I was raised in the<a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/bronxgunhillhouses.shtml"> Gun Hill Housing Projects</a> in Bronx, New York on Magenta Street. I had<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic"> WIC</a> in my family. It’s something that you don’t really understand until you’re older. Having some of this assistance was critical to my family.”</p>
<p>Rose believes that benefiting from these types of programs helped her stay on track and opened up opportunities like college and interning at the White House where she took further interest in policy, programs, and learning how to take a macro-level concept and “bring it to back to the everyday person through technology.”</p>
<p>She cites three “catalytic”motivators that have accelerated her evolution and pursuit of mRelief:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1 &#8211; <a href="http://chihacknight.org/">Open Government Hack Night at 1871</a></strong>: The founding trio began attending the weekly hack night while they were students at the<a href="http://www.starterleague.com/"> Starter League</a>. “Open Government Hack Night created a space where government people could connect with people like me who are interested in learning how to code, have a policy background and personal experiences that make these problems really relevant &#8211; that made me willing to put my skin in the game, and willing to go hard. The mayor’s office came and stated that this was a problem, and within a week we had built a prototype.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2 &#8211; <a href="http://byp100.org/">Black Youth Project 100:</a></strong> Rose is a National Membership Chair of BYP100, an “activist member-based organization of Black 18-35 year olds, dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people.”  During a retreat brainstorming session on pain points and problem solving, “it was unanimous around the room that the humiliation that people experience through public assistance was one of the biggest issues and challenges. It’s something that stayed with me &#8211; there is pain around having to ask for help and being unsure how to get it.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3 &#8211; Carrying a torch</strong> &#8211; “It’s about carrying a torch. There’s an awesome and robust history of advocates who found a home in social services. I like to consider myself someone who is emerging in that space and really trying to &#8211; through the lens of tech, gender, and policy &#8211; solve these broken parts of the system.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On other disrupters in the public service space</span></strong>:<br />
“I have to say this &#8211; People say government is slow and bureaucratic, but I really love the innovation delivery teams that are thinking through how to problem solve within government. I really think that<a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/"> Bloomberg Philanthropies</a> has knocked it out of the park. And<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"> 18F</a> is hella dope, right? In terms of public benefits eligibility,<a href="https://www.gov.uk/"> the UK</a> knocks my socks off. And<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyfaustino"> Rey Faustino</a> of<a href="https://www.1deg.org/"> One Degree</a> is the real deal.”</p>
<hr />
<p>When asked about what she wants to contribute to the dialogue on minorities and women in tech and entrepreneurship, she keeps it simple,­ “This is for you too.”</p>

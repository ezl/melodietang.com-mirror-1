				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Aaron Frazin<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Application that researches the people you are scheduled to meet with and sends you insight briefings before your meeting<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: https://charlieapp.com; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecharlieapp">Facebook</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/AppCharlie">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: January 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_472" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aaronbowtiecrop2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-472" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aaronbowtiecrop2-300x300.jpg" alt="Aaron Frazin, Charlie App" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aaron Frazin, <a href="https://charlieapp.com">Charlie App</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.guru.com/freelancers/ryan-lunde/portfolio">Ryan Lunde</a></p></div>
<p>Aaron Frazin is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://charlieapp.com/">Charlie App</a>, an online application that compiles research and sends you a summary of what you need to nail your next meeting. He dropped out of his senior year of college to accept an invitation to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kauffman.org%2F&amp;ei=MRu8VIrkOIicygTUjYHYBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2zAdePaHkIa8vBOP9rHpRFxRiaQ&amp;sig2=r_REkAs2wJ3c2DGYMnjlPw&amp;bvm=bv.83829542,d.aWw">Kauffman Foundation</a> in pursuit of Charlie App and has not looked back. He aims to become a ‘cool grandpa’ one day who has 1) Changed and innovated something(s) in the world. 2) Lived a life with stories worth repeating. 3) Spread happiness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On being a natural entrepreneur</span></strong>:<br />
Aaron says he didn’t always identify with the terms “founder” or “entrepreneur” necessarily, but he just acted like one from a young age.</p>
<p>“I just always was. When I was 11 I started animating. I asked my parents for some animation and flash software. Don’t know why.” He began finding clients online shortly afterwards. “When I was 13, I told everyone that I was 18 and I would never meet anyone in person and would only meet them over AOL Messenger. Every year I told people I was 18 and no one ever figured it out.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the idea and getting started</span></strong>:<br />
It was the same type of hustle he had as a kid that got Charlie off the ground when he was in college. He came up with the idea after spending a lot of time interviewing companies and recruiters for a job fair. To see if it was an idea worth pursuing, he and his friends offered 3 free briefings from the product (that they had not built) to 30 different executives and sales professionals. For a few weeks, Aaron and his friends stayed up late manually researching and compiling summaries.</p>
<p>“At the time I thought it was so dumb. I’m supposed to create a company and I’m just doing research every day on other peoples’ meetings! Looking back on it, it was one of the most important things we ever did. We were able to get people to say they wanted to pay for it – we learned what people are willing to pay for, what they won’t pay for, and why.”</p>
<p>They used the research and information to prioritize and focus on where to start building first.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On using what you have going for you</span></strong>:<br />
“Some people might be rich so they can fund their startup – so use that.  Some people might already have a ton of connections – so use that. Some people can animate – so use that. Some people are amazing at sales – so use that. For me, one of the things I have going for me is that I’m young. So I’m going to use it.”</p>
<p>“Everyone wants to help the 20-something year old entrepreneur who is just trying to figure things out. I actually e-mailed people who had been CEOs of much bigger companies, and in the subject line said ‘Advice for a young entrepreneur’. People wanted to respond because they felt like they’d been in my shoes before. That’s how I was able to meet a ton of people.” (Aaron writes about asking for help in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-frazin/the-science-behind-gettin_b_2119265.html">Huffington Post</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“There isn’t one recipe for success. Everything everyone tells you and everything you read is just a data point. Use what works for you. So many companies have been created in so many different ways. Determine what you think is best for you and go for it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On focusing on what counts</span></strong>:<br />
An exciting moment for the Charlie App team came when they were featured in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2F2013%2F03%2F09%2Fcharlie-app%2F&amp;ei=siC8VOSOGYKQyATDl4HwCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdCF5p0mAf_J7fBB-Z-nTAzylQeA&amp;sig2=DgZJvLzWUfYd-t9s1OZM8Q&amp;bvm=bv.83829542,d.aWw">Mashable</a> after being selected as a <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/startupvillage/accelerator">SXSW Accelerator</a> Finalist.</p>
<p>“We thought – ‘We are amazing!’ But, one of our advisers told us that it didn’t matter and press doesn’t matter. ‘Your users matter and your key metrics matter and those are the only things that matter. Take a minute and enjoy that, but remember the things that matter.’”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Anytime something like that happens we celebrate for a minute, but we know what the important things that matter are, and that we have to focus on those. Image is not success. It’s about how well you’re solving the problem of your users.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On building a team</span>:</strong><br />
At the time of the interview, there were 9 people on the Charlie App team. They recently started the interview process to add a new engineer to the team. They started with about 100 candidates, and continued interviewing for 8 months before finally making a hire they felt was right.</p>
<p>“Don’t settle. You cannot. When your startup is this early, every single person is a leader and will be the leadership team for years to come. It has to be someone we love to be around, someone who is super smart- smarter than us. It’s very important to us to keep our team like a family because we have a chance to make it right and build a foundation.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On funding:</span></strong><br />
To date, Charlie App has raised $1.75M.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Funding follows success, success does not follow funding. Remember what’s important and when you’re achieving that, then investors will come to you. In movies it’s all about the pitch and persuasion. But investors are smart and they’re going to get down to what the most important things are to your business. And if those things are truly going well, then you’ll see funding.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On momentum</span>:</strong><br />
“It’s all hustle in the beginning. After that the only thing I found to be true is momentum. As you have more and more momentum things get easier. Nothing you read will help you except hustle and finding out what resonates with the people you’re targeting. You’re going to fail 1000 times, but eventually you’ll get your first employee, and raise your first round.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not about taking short cuts &#8211; it’s just going to be hard. But you can power through it, even if most people won’t.  If you decide to keep powering through it, then know that it’s hard and know that it gets easier and easier with momentum. Your goal is to solve the problem and keep creating momentum.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You can find the Charlie App team going to concerts together and throwing dinner parties to foster collaboration in the startup community. They continue to focus on their customer needs and key metrics while hustling to keep the momentum going. “I sleep thinking about it, I wake up thinking about it. I just want to solve the problems.”</p>

<p>Jeremy Klein is the original founder and member of the co-founder trio at Table Savvy. Jeremy grew up in Cleveland, went to Indiana University and did his MBA at DePaul in Chicago and is (that’s right, still is) a trader at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>He talks to me like we’re already friends and is nice enough to start by saying, “I’m so glad you reached out.” We chat about how we both love San Francisco, CA and Austin, TX. Eventually, we get into how he ended up as Morgan Stanley trader by day, Table Savvy entrepreneur by night.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the idea and early pitches</b></span>:</p>
<p>The idea started a few years ago when Jeremy had some friends coming into town and they needed a last minute dinner reservation at a good restaurant on a Thursday night. It was a “wouldn&#8217;t it be great if….” type of conversation that snowballed into Jeremy getting up the nerve to pitch to<a title="Light Bank" href="http://www.lightbank.com/"> Light Bank</a> in the fall of 2010.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><i>It was intimidating for me to have an idea because I didn&#8217;t know what to do, I didn&#8217;t know who to talk to and what the next step was.</i> <i>I almost wanted to prove the idea wrong, just so I wouldn&#8217;t have to go through all the steps</i><i>.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>After a quick rejection from Light Bank, he moved on to<a href="http://www.sandboxindustries.com/"> Sand Box</a> which was another rejection. Although rejected, he got an introduction to Rick Desai from <a href="http://www.dashfire.com/#slide-main">Dashfire</a> which enabled him to start product development.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On customer acquisition and reach</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>When he first started pitching to Chicago restaurants, he didn&#8217;t get any traction or interest. The restaurants weren&#8217;t convinced that Table SAVVY had the distribution necessary for users to take advantage of the product. Up to this point, Jeremy had been very hush-hush about what he was doing<i>.</i> “I believed in stealth theory and that you needed to keep it quiet. I’d just seen the Facebook movie, so I was still paranoid. Finally I said screw it.&#8221;<b> </b></p>
<blockquote><p><i>How will people know how to help me if they don’t know what I’m doing?”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>His Facebook post caught the attention of someone he’d met through a friend at a concert who worked at Chicago Magazine and offered an introduction. Jeremy pitched to Chicago Magazine, they were on-board and everything changed. After securing the partnership, restaurants were ready to sign-up.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Jeremy acknowledges that customer acquisition is the biggest challenge at the beginning for startups. &#8220;You can’t use the fact that you don’t have any money to not get any customers. When you don’t have money, turn into your own PR person. Leverage everything you possibly can.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On living 2 lives</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>Jeremy and his co-founders are all still moonlighting at Table SAVVY while keeping their full time jobs. He is in a unique position since the markets close at 3 pm and restaurant owners aren&#8217;t starting their shift until dinner service.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>“I went to my boss a year into doing this and told him that I had a passion project on the side. At 3 pm I go into the closet and change into jeans and a t shirt and go into 1871. It’s a long day, it’s a weird day and it’s two drastically different jobs. If it wasn&#8217;t in the restaurant industry, it’d be super tough.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On learning</span>:</b></p>
<p>I ask Jeremy if any of his trading skills have helped him in the start-up world &#8211; apparently, not really. “No, it is totally different. The stupidest stuff was very intimidating. Just take it one at a time and you’ll find that you get deeper and deeper and you turn around and you&#8217;ve figured things out. It’s a lot of on the fly learning.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What you’ll learn is that you don’t know how to do anything at first&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what ‘they’ do tell you, but you can’t prepare fo</b></span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">r</span>:</b></p>
<p>“You have to take rejection well. You need to have confidence in what you’re doing. 99% of people are going to say, ‘No’. You can never prepare yourself for what people tell you. You don’t realize how high of a threshold you have until you are challenged with it. We&#8217;ve had a lot of very good days, but there a lot of negative ones. It’s a roller coaster. People do tell you before, but you have no idea how right they are until you’re actually in it. It’s not that an idea is better, it’s about your tolerance.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you give up, then there’s a zero percent chance of it working.”</em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Since our chat, Table Savvy has launched their mobile app in the Android store and should be going-live with a Hotel Tonight application integration soon. On top of that, they are securing investors and hoping to bring on an in-house technology team to support their growth. Be spontaneous and reserve a last-minute dinner date with Table SAVVY!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Jimmy Odom<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: WeDeliver brings on demand delivery to neighborhood businesses.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a title="http://www.wedeliver.us/" href="http://www.wedeliver.us/">http://www.wedeliver.us/</a><br />
<b>Date of interview</b>: October 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_176" style="width: 244px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jimmy-odom-we-deliver.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-176" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jimmy-odom-we-deliver-215x300.jpg" alt="Jimmy Odom, We Deliver" width="234" height="327" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jimmy Odom, <a href="https://www.wedeliver.us/">We Deliver</a><br />Art by <a href="http://lukemart.in/">Luke Martin</a> of <a href="http://www.wtlcomic.com/"> What the L?! comics</a> and more</p></div>
<p>Jimmy wasn&#8217;t my first interview, but I wanted to lead with him for a few reasons. Firstly, because it was this coffee date that gave me the idea of the site name. But other than that, he is just so electric and passionate &#8211; it seemed like an obvious opening post.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On figuring out what he wanted to do</b></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I have a different view on life and careers than most people. I think if you’re good at one thing, you can be good at anything. Throughout my life, I have come across things that I was really passionate about and that I really enjoyed. I’m driven by passion. That’s what gets me excited, that’s what gets me up every morning. </i><em>It’s totally random &#8211; it touches my heart and I become passionate about it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(You can read from <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130205/BLOGS11/130209922/how-wedeliver-is-taking-a-page-from-airbnb-and-lyft">Crain’s</a> and <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/25005698-418/jimmy-odom-uses-his-drive-to-deliver.html">Chicago Sun Times</a> that he has a diverse past exploring careers in culinary arts, screenwriting, and even emergency medicine.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On entrepreneurship and ideation</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>I asked him if he always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He looks at me and explains that it wasn’t about wanting it, he has just always been one.</p>
<p>“I’ve always done it. I was that kid on my block who organized all the basketball tournaments. I was always doing it, I just didn’t know there was a term for it. I do wish someone had identified me as I grew up. I’m learning now, but I think it could’ve honed my skills a little more at an early age. I’m so glad that entrepreneurship is actually being encouraged in the school system now. Not everyone is going to be an entrepreneur, but we all have the ability to be one.”</p>
<p>In terms of his ideas &#8211; they “just happen”. He doesn&#8217;t have a special process for it, he doesn&#8217;t sit around and brainstorm and they’re not always triggered by anything.</p>
<p>“They just come. It’s been like this all my life. They just come. I could be sitting at home doing absolutely nothing that has to do with my idea. Just happens.” (Good luck trying to replicate that, people.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On coming up with WeDeliver</b></span>:</p>
<p>While he was working for Apple (a job he says he absolutely loved), he went to Stanford Startup School and came back on an inspirational high.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I came back and I was just on fire for entrepreneurship, and on fire for technology. Being surrounded by some of the smartest people in the world… that was electrifying and invigorating.&#8221; </i></p></blockquote>
<p>He knew he wanted to build something, but it was just a matter of what. He thought of it after his mother asked him to pick up a prescription for her.</p>
<p>“The pharmacy was right next to the pizza delivery place. It just didn&#8217;t make sense. Why doesn&#8217;t it (on demand delivery) exist? Let’s build it. Simply put- it was just the right place at the right time and I knew I wanted to do this.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On building a team</b></span>:</p>
<p>Jimmy doesn&#8217;t consider building a team to be a traditional hiring process.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If you look at the creation of the planets &#8211; there are just interactions, collisions and chaos. And from chaos, comes order.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_56" style="width: 417px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image.png"><img class="wp-image-56" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image.png" alt="Illustration by Alexa Tang" width="407" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by Alexa Tang</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Developing a team in the early stages &#8211; those were just collisions &#8211; meeting people in the environment and seeing who you stick with through gravitational pulls. That’s how we all met. It wasn&#8217;t probably until employee 15 that I started to think more strategically about who comes into the company and what role they will fill. That is something I had to change in terms of how I look at growing the company.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting customers</b></span>:</p>
<p>“I literally went from door to door down Chicago avenue.”</p>
<p>Now that he has customers, his approach is still the same except that WeDeliver is getting a good amount of referral business as well. “If you want to build a business that empowers local businesses you need to get out, you need to talk to them, you need to see them, you need to meet them. I like to have a relationship with you.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On handling rejection</span>:</b><br />
<i></i></p>
<p>“Each time it was good to reinforce that I’m not doing this to get into an event, I’m not doing this to get into a competition, I’m doing this because I see this business growing and I like my customers. I love what we do. Those other things are ancillary, they’re extra. It’s not the substance of the cake &#8211; it’s just frosting. It was so important for us to get back into the right mind set. It is all a mindset and how you think.”</p>
<p>(WeDeliver did NOT get into Tech Week or Tech Starters the first time around.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On advice ‘they’ don’t tell you</b></span>:</p>
<p>Apparently it is all about trusting yourself and learning from the right sci-fi hero.</p>
<p>“It’s so important for entrepreneurs to truly trust their instincts &#8211; to believe in themselves. We look at those that have built companies and think that whatever they know is better than what I know, whatever they&#8217;ve done is better than what I&#8217;ve done. I&#8217;ve met a ton of mentors over the last 2 years and each potential mentor comes and assesses a problem as if they have first hand knowledge of everything. You see something others don’t see &#8211; that’s why you’re the innovator. You see further down the road and you see what others don’t see &#8211; or else they would have built it. Trust the vision. Others can help shape it, but you have to trust your vision. <b> </b>If you can align mission, vision and purpose with metrics &#8211; then some really interesting things happen.”</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you watch the show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)">Heroes</a>? Two of the most powerful characters of the show are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylar">Sylar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Petrelli">Peter</a>. Sylar has to be hands on and dirty to accumulate abilities and become the all powerful villain. Peter just has to be next to you &#8211; just in your presence and he can get your ability. That’s what I want to be like. As an entrepreneur, I want to surround myself with amazing people so that the more I’m around them &#8211; I can see their skill set, see what makes them special, learn from them, and make them part of my team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy starts telling me a story after I&#8217;ve stopped recording and while he’s grabbing for his iPhone. He tells me that yesterday he left his iPhone on the train. After realizing he left it, he begins to track it via the GPS in his phone. He continues to drive next to the train that has his phone and realizes that his phone got off the train and has gone to an actual physical address. Against his wife’s advice, he decides he will see this to the end. He walks up to the door, rings the doorbell, asks for his phone back, gets it back and goes on with his day. I think this story represents his general spirit &#8211; he <b>sees</b> it, he <b>cares</b> about it, he goes to <b>get it</b>.</p>

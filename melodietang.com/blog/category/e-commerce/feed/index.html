				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>COO</strong>: Kris Petersen<br />
<strong>Company Description:</strong> Curated clothing service for kids &#8211;  ‘Trunk Club for kids’<br />
<strong>Company Site:</strong> <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">https://www.macandmia.com/</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/macmiastyle" target="_blank">@MacMiaStyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/krispetersen">@KrisPetersen</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview:</strong> September 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_733" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kris-petersen-1.png"><img class="wp-image-733 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kris-petersen-1-300x293.png" alt="Kris Petersen, Mac and Mia" width="300" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kris Petersen, <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/">Mac and Mia</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DeBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Kris Petersen is a serial entrepreneur, founder, and currently the COO of <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a>, a responsibly sourced “<a href="http://trunkclub.com/" target="_blank">Trunk Club</a> for kids.” His favorite place in the world is Door County, Wisconsin and his favorite food is Chicago pizza.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On learning and creativity</strong></span>:<br />
Kris taught himself to code back in middle school, took a class in college, and then really dug into it after hours while he was a consultant for IBM.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For me, learning to code was really an outlet for creativity and building. When I was in corporate America, I always felt something was missing. That’s why I turned to development on nights and weekends &#8211; to fill my creative need to do something. Those activities were never centered around money or building a business.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“People forget they have that ability to learn. In the shuffling of the every day you just think you never have time.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building his way to Mac and Mia</strong></span>:<br />
After many years of working as a corporate technology consultant and launching web applications on the side, Kris joined the world of venture-funding, entrepreneurship and startups. One of his major development projects, <a href="http://www.neighborhuddle.com/" target="_blank">Neighborhuddle</a>, was a content management system for condo boards. It inspired his first official product, <a href="http://www.dealsgoround.com/" target="_blank">DealsGoRound</a> (later rebranded as myCabbage), a second-hand market for daily deal coupons. DealsGoRound caught the attention of the press and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lefkofsky" target="_blank">Eric Lefkofsky</a>, which led Kris to become an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at <a href="http://www.lightbank.com/" target="_blank">Lightbank</a>.</p>
<p>“With coding came the ability to build different things. My entrance into the venture capital world came by way of the guys at Lightbank finding me doing interesting things in the weeds and introducing me to this world.”</p>
<p>After DealsGoRound was acquired, Kris became the CTO of Betterfly, a video-chat learning platform that was sold to <a href="https://takelessons.com/">TakeLessons</a>. He then became the co-founder of <a href="https://www.eatmorsel.com/" target="_blank">Morsel</a>, and is now the COO of <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a> under founder Marie Tillman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On acquisitions and corporate development</strong></span>:<br />
Kris has raised multiple rounds of funding, gone through two acquisitions and has danced with big companies on corporate development. With Mac and Mia, the business currently only has angel investors and is “very calculated on who we talk to and who can add value to the business.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to acquisitions, there&#8217;s a lot of fishing expeditions going on from larger companies. In the end, there may not be a lot of serious interest. When you get that corporate development e-mail from Google, you feel like ‘Holy cow- I’m going to go buy an island!’ The reality is that it is someone’s job all day long to send out emails like that. At the end of the day they may have no interest other than figuring out what’s happening in the space.You have to be careful because it is incredibly time consuming, and it also mentally rattles you a little bit.”<br />
<span class="im"> </span><br />
“Corporate development can be a total distraction from a startup&#8217;s business. You hope to be in the position of power and I think if you are you’ll know. And if you feel like you’re not, then you’re not.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On ideas versus execution:</strong></span><br />
“It takes a lot of motivation for someone to work on something that’s unproven, that’s hard, that might not make money. The alternative is to flip on Tivo and watch the latest episode of something.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s no shortage of people with ideas. 99.9% of them never take the first step.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On executing with purpose</strong></span>:<br />
With Mac and Mia, Kris has evolved his clarity on executing purposefully and believing in values outside of driving a business. His daily purpose at Mac and Mia is straight-forward &#8211; “Getting boxes out the door and increasing the number of orders”. Along with that, Mac and Mia supports a larger purpose of responsible manufacturing and local business support that Kris can get behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m moving forward a lot more purposefully with what I’m working on right now. My personality is that I just get things done &#8211; but the question is, ‘Are you getting the right things done?’ It is about supporting a single measurable goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“In the past, I was just building things because people thought they were good ideas. With Mac and Mia the big picture felt right to me. I want to work on something I believe in. There’s a massive emphasis on women entrepreneurs, sourcing responsibly, sourcing locally, and responsible manufacturing. Every dollar we spend on inventory is deeply researched. “</p>
<hr />
<p>What get Kris excited? &#8211; “Mac and Mia gets me excited. I genuinely believe Mac and Mia will be a massive company.” Learn more about <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/about/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a> and how to add “connection and discovery” to children’s clothing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Corbett Drummey<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Marketplace for products or cash in exchange for posting about brands on Instagram<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://www.popularpays.com/" target="_blank">http://www.popularpays.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PopularPays" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/popularpays" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/popularpays" target="_blank">Instagram</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: December 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_504" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Corbett2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-504" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Corbett2-300x300.jpg" alt="Corbett Drummey, Popular Pays" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Corbett Drummey, <a href="http://www.popularpays.com/">Popular Pays</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Corbett Drummey is the founder and CEO of Popular Pays, an online marketplace that connects local businesses and major brands with the influential Instagrammers of the world. Like Mark Zuckerberg (but he swears he was already doing this), he pretty much wears the same thing every day (with or without the holes) and saves his mental energy for his priorities. I caught him on the eve of his move to San Francisco to embark on his next big journey with the team &#8211; hacking it on the West Coast. He sings, plays guitar, and loves Hemingway.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On being in startups</strong></span>:<br />
Corbett is one of those guys who always wanted to be an entrepreneur. In college he created and ran a tutoring company that connected college tutors with children.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="im"> </span>“I’m a wannabe college dropout. I worked on this startup in college and was always bummed out that I didn&#8217;t drop out to pursue it full time. I knew I could’ve &#8211; and we had a team that was ready to do it, but we chickened out.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="im"> </span>After doing an internship at Leo Burnett, he took a full-time offer there after graduation. “The whole time I worked at Leo (which was less than a year) I was always itching to do a side project. This is definitely where I want to be. I didn&#8217;t feel fulfilled until I started doing this.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“I love startups. I&#8217;ve met the smartest and most interesting people, and they do the coolest shit and have the best ethos and culture. You’re based on results. With startups you can’t fake it- you get it right or you fail. It&#8217;s not like school where you do homework to please a teacher. Startups are very real. You’re on your own &#8211; and that’s the scary part. No one is coming to check in on you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the idea</strong></span>:<br />
Corbett and his previous co-founder, Allan Holmes, came up with the original idea haphazardly at a party.<span class="im"> </span></p>
<p>“We had a whole list of ideas. The trick is doing it and persistence. I pushed him to actually take steps to do it. The next day I took him to <a href="http://www.piecechicago.com/" target="_blank">Piece</a> and made us pitch it to them. That slowly evolved into the idea of merchants offering something in exchange for a photo. It evolved organically, and keeps evolving. Small merchants are really cool, but they can’t float the whole business. So we have to start working with the Nikes and the American Apparels.” (In October, Popular Pays launched Paid Gigs, a new feature where brands can post paid gigs for Instagrammers to apply to.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On money &#8211;  savings, funding, run rates</span></strong>:<br />
In September 2014, Popular Pays closed a $500K funding round. Then, in October 2014, they launched Paid Gigs, which got up to a quarter million dollar run rate in the first 30 days. “It was a good feeling &#8211; up until then we weren’t making any money.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I quit Leo Burnett with only $3K in savings and we made it last 3 months &#8211; which is really amazing. I was down to $120 before we got our first investor check. I finally got the investor check in the mail and when I cashed it they froze my accounts because they thought it was fraudulent!”</p></blockquote>
<p>“The first year was super, super stressful &#8211; but it got easier. The last 4-5 months have been like heaven. Things have been working so well that it makes me anxious, because I’m used to things breaking. Now we can turn down some offers and we can pick where we want to take it from. But up until that… gosh, what a struggle!”</p>
<p>At the time of the interview, Popular Pays had raised $775K in funding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On lessons learned</strong></span>:<br />
“I’m surprised we’re still around and I wish I would&#8217;ve known this stuff when I started. You want people who are just an animal in terms of their work habits. They are really passionate and very, very dedicated. Business is a minefield, and the further they can navigate the minefield without you, the better.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the things I learned how to do was focus. I tried to do everything when I started and that’s the wrong thing to do. You have to choose a few things that are really important and then let the rest slide. That would&#8217;ve saved me so much time. There are 1000 things you could be doing right now and 3 of them matter. If you just focus on those 3, then you have more time to work …. or go live your life.<span class="im"> </span></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“So focus on the important things, choose your team wisely, and don’t stress as much &#8211; because it all works out.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On how he personally feels about social media</strong></span>:<br />
“So controversial. When I come in and I’m worried about taking a picture or checking in, then I&#8217;m never actually in the moment and experiencing it. But, I also love how my previous co-founder, Allan, used to always take photos and document things. I have no documentation in my life right now and I had so much when I lived with him. When I’m 40, I’m going to be so happy looking back on those times. I just couldn&#8217;t be the one to do it because I have to engage in the moment to be happy. So it&#8217;s a weird thing for me because I like being present instead of sharing &#8211; it&#8217;s a distraction.”</p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">So how does one get in on this type of marketplace? “Like anything, if you really want to do it &#8211; then it&#8217;s just practice. I got up from 200 to 1200 followers because I posted a photo every day &#8211; because I knew I needed to. The cool thing is that if you are posting regularly and engaging in the app, then you’ll get good at it. All you have to do is care. I really hope that we are enabling a creative class.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Ross Petersen, Ryan Petersen, Katy Weade, Ab Fadel<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Online arts and crafts retailer<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://blitsy.com/" target="_blank">https://blitsy.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blitsycrafts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blitsycrafts" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BlitsyCrafts" target="_blank">YouTube</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: December 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_477" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ross-final-.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-477" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ross-final--300x226.jpg" alt="Ross Petersen, Blitsy" width="300" height="226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ross Petersen, <a href="https://blitsy.com/">Blitsy<br />Art by </a><a href="http://johnroseillustration.com">John Rose</a></p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Ross Petersen is the CEO and co-founder of Blitsy. He comes from an ancestry of entrepreneurship and has deep industry knowledge through the family business and his own work experience &#8211; which includes starting and selling a startup to Michaels, North America’s largest crafting retailer. He believes in family, quick decisions, learning, ethics, living without regrets…. and letting the family pets inspire the office.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On his previous startups and building up to Blitsy</strong>:<br />
</span>After college, Ross and his twin brother, Ryan, actually started Vintage Revived, a drop-shipping site for t-shirts, as a way to earn some extra money to help pay their mortgage while they worked full time jobs. In 2008, Ryan came home with a “sit up in your seat idea” for ScrapHD, a digital scrapbooking platform. They brought in their older sister, Kat<span style="color: #000000;">y</span>, and current Blitsy CTO, Ab, to be part of the team as well. Within 18 months, they went from launch to exit and sold their software to Michaels in 2010.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Back then I was so green to everything. Venture capital wasn&#8217;t even really an option. It was just about thinking through a sound business idea and executing against it. I think that’s a good way to think through it for any entrepreneur.”</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="im"> </span>“Don’t get too far ahead of yourself.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After getting bought by Michaels, Ryan continued working for their dad’s distribution company and Ross and Katy went in-house at Michaels. Then, in November 2011, Ryan launched the original version of Blitsy as a side project. Shortly after, the original ScrapHD team reunited and decided that Blitsy was worth pursuing as a stand-alone product. In July 2012, Ross pitched to a Chicago-based venture capital firm and started getting serious traction.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="im"> </span>“That’s really when it was game on.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On entrepreneurship DNA</strong></span>:<br />
“One of the biggest issues for most people in starting a business is accepting the risk. I think that I’m a naturally risky individual. I don’t know if it is nature or nurture. I think some of it is that we are just true entrepreneurs. We have a lot of the DNA for it and I’m finding that out more as I continue. The fact that they (his family) were successful entrepreneurs lowered the barrier of entry for us to think about becoming entrepreneurs and starting a business.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t live having any regrets about anything. When I think about the way I naturally process things &#8211; I&#8217;ve just always allowed negative to roll off and focus on the positive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On networking, collaborating and transparency</strong></span>:<br />
“When I first started out I was very stealth-minded. I didn&#8217;t want to share my view and ideas and wanted to be under the radar with building. For some ideas that makes sense, but not for the vast majority. The best advice I would give is to not be stealthy &#8211; be screaming from the top of your lungs to everyone and anyone who will listen to your ideas and thoughts so that you can hear their feedback. I recognized over the course of time that it’s a huge advantage to actually talk to people &#8211; whether it is investors or other entrepreneurs or anyone. The more the merrier &#8211; I’m learning from everyone. Back in the day, that wasn&#8217;t my mindset.”</p>
<p>“Most people should want to talk. If you feel strongly about your market and the opportunities you’re going after, then you should have no hesitancy to talk through these things.”</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="im"> </span>“There’s enough here for all of us.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On investors and funding</strong></span>:<br />
With ScrapHD, the team bootstrapped from their friends and family to launch it. “With the first company, I wasn&#8217;t sophisticated enough to even think through it. I was just genuinely passionate about the idea and we had enough capital to get to that MVP (minimum viable product). I was not worried, for whatever reason. I felt so strongly about what I was doing. In my mind, there was no doubt that I’d get them their money back. If venture capitalism had been part of my background, maybe I might have negotiated a little differently.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Blitsy, the scene, timing and vision were different. Ross and team saw a huge opportunity to disrupt the industry and wanted to be the first to market. “It became natural to realize we needed outside help besides friends and family. I’m using this money to accelerate growth by doing X, Y and Z. You don’t just raise capital because you’re up against the guys with big pockets. You do it to get a strategic advantage or allow a ramp up fast enough to disrupt the industry.”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you if what I’m doing is right or wrong, but I’m doing what I feel is right. We&#8217;ve ramped up pretty aggressively. I heard once that when you start accepting funding you have to imagine yourself running as fast as you can towards a brick wall.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Right before you hit impact, you hope someone jumps in front of you and helps you hurdle that wall before you have to do it all over again.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On managing people along with growth</strong></span>:<br />
Ross is not shy about supporting a quick hire and quick fire mentality. “It’s managing personalities not so much the role. I&#8217;ve learned a little more about what I’m looking for in a hire. I try to be upfront about everything. We’re very transparent with our data. I let people know exactly how I’m feeling and where we’re at. I want them to know what they’re getting into so that there are no surprises. We have a phenomenal team in place right now.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Ross believes that it’s not just about the opportunity that Blitsy is seizing in the marketplace. It’s also about providing a platform that gives manufacturing brands a way to survive against the big box brick and mortar retailers. “Someone has to come in and support these manufacturers that are attempting to sell online amidst the declining shelf space and visibility at box retailers who continue to favor their own private labels. We’re helping create jobs and making sure these brands survive.”</p>

<strong>Company Description</strong>: Membership organization that connects and helps business and technology women entrepreneurs<br />

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole Yeary is the founder of Ms. Tech, a membership organization that helps business and technology women entrepreneurs collaborate, network and ultimately invest in each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On learning the ropes</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole spent many successful years working in health insurance business development and sales. In 2008, she decided to pursue her own healthcare startup, and even with her years of industry expertise and knowledge, she found herself faced with a whole new world of challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“The startup world was so different than any business world I’d ever known.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To tackle the learning curve, she ended up taking a job with a newly funded startup as their first official full-time hire. She asked questions; she attended pitch events; she took additional gigs. This all pre-dated the current startup scene in Chicago &#8211;  pre 1871, Starter League, Startup Weekend, and BuiltIn Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On switching pursuits to Ms. Tech</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Following her natural spirit of collaboration, Nicole attended and formed informal communities through brunches (#shygirlbrunch) and created a Facebook group to bring business and technology-focused women together for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“I wanted to make something that we could share and take going to lunch or brunch together to another level. I wanted to see us all get something out of it.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“How can we do business together? How can we transfer the wealth among us, and how can we invest in each other?”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the Facebook group, she realized that “the knowledge share was huge. People fed off of that. They got excited. There were a ton of smart women sharing what they knew and together we created a community that provided networking along with an added layer of well curated mind-sharing. That became an incredible resource, an instant perceived value to our Ms.Tech tribe and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In January 2014, Ms. Tech became an official entity and added a First Class Membership option. Today, they have about 100 members.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On examining the issues</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">“Only 2.7% of venture-backed startups are female founded &#8212; that&#8217;s not the problem. That&#8217;s the issue caused by a deeper rooted problem. To really uncover the root cause of this issue has been a journey. We started by asking questions: How many women need startup capital? How many women are pitching VCs? How much are they asking for? Do they know how to navigate the due diligence process? These are all questions we are working on so that we can develop impact measurement; develop the most viable solution that will create the greatest impact; and truly leverage greater economic empowerment for all women.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole wants to  focus her time on identifying sources of the actual problem. &#8220;Our First Class membership has taken us from a Facebook group to an organization that is serious about working on a solution by taking assumptions and putting them through the same lean methodology to test our hypothesis. That makes us incredibly grateful for every partner and First Class member.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On unifying as a community to succeed</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole believes that at every level, banding together is more powerful than operating apart. “The conversation is split among women as well. Not everyone has the same networks and the same accessibility.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“We are challenged together. We are investing in each other and changing the status quo so anyone can disrupt industries. I would like to see women I know continue to lift each other up, take a vested interest in each other&#8217;s work, and do business with one another.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Even in Chicago there is some traditional segregation between neighborhoods and communities. I continue to work toward a ‘Team Chicago’ mentality, a message of pride in what the people in our city are doing. We should become cognizant of what similar social missions are represented by other organizations, and take inventory of our strengths and opportunities to become cohesive.”</span></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">You can find Nicole at 1871 brainstorming and researching the most effective ways to make impact &#8211; “All of my work is done ‘to impact’ first. My purpose is to make tangible change and create impact. &#8220;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Profile</strong>: Elizabeth Peterson, Eastwood Group<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Payment integration consulting and FinTech software product development<br />
<strong>Website</strong>: <a href="http://www.elizabetheastwood.com/" target="_blank">http://www.elizabetheastwood.<wbr />com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/chitownlizzy" target="_blank">@Chitownlizzy</a><br />
<strong>Date of interview</strong>: October 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_739" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson.png"><img class="wp-image-739 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson-300x293.png" alt="Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group" width="300" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group <br /> Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco Dibattista</a></p></div>
<p>Elizabeth Peterson is an artist, an entrepreneur, a mother, a seeker of truth and continuous improvement. She started her education in arts and fashion, but ended up with a career in financial technology; and is in the process of creating payment software to change the pace of payment on-boarding and integration.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On how she got from art to finance to startups</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth actually went to school for fine arts, came to Chicago to be in fashion design, and quickly discovered that she wasn’t interested in staying in the fashion industry. She changed her trajectory and ended up with a 10 year long career in financial technology services, which developed her expertise in payment integration infrastructure and implementations for large clients.</p>
<p>“I’m a terrible employee though. I like to find loopholes and skip over everything. I never stop at my job title. I always want to boil the ocean and am looking for what’s next all the time. I’m not an office person. I can’t draw in the lines and follow all the rules.”</p>
<p>Though she generally only consulted for larger companies, her client portfolio brought her in contact with a few earlier stage companies that needed her services.</p>
<p>“I was instructed to help out these much larger companies, and had very high revenue targets. But my gut was telling me that it was really these guys (early stage companies) that needed my help. This was the energy that I wanted to be a part of, so I had to put myself there.”</p>
<p>After being introduced to the <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a> community, she had the opportunity to do payment integration consulting for <a href="http://www.rippleshot.com/" target="_blank">Rippleshot</a>, <a href="http://sportslock.com/" target="_blank">Sportslock</a>, and <a href="http://www.getoccasion.com/" target="_blank">Occasion</a>, which gave her confidence to use what she’d learned and validated to begin driving the creation of her own software to better meet clients&#8217; needs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the startup community and scaling</strong></span>:</p>
<p>“I think the startup world in Chicago has a heart of gold. It’s amazing how all of them are connected and partner together on different projects. There’s a different community in startups &#8211; it’s more like family. Everyone wants to help everyone out &#8211; crowd sourcing, camaraderie, transparency.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s specialty is helping startup companies scale their payment technology and infrastructure.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s like watching your kids grow up. You watch these companies go through name changes and team changes &#8211; and now they’re getting millions in funding, and have great success stories. It’s an amazing thing to be a part of, and now it is my turn to be a success story.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On mission, inspiration, and mentorship</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth says that she looks for mentors that share her mission, and confesses that connecting with mentors did not come naturally.</p>
<p>“Mentorship was a hard thing to take on for me. I tend to think that I can do everything on my own and wear a million different hats. But you can’t. I’m learning to delegate to people who are better than me and learn from people 10-15 years ahead of me.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth is inspired by the “radical generosity” among women entrepreneurs started by <a href="https://sheeo.world/#home" target="_blank">SheEO</a> founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsaunders" target="_blank">Vicki Saunders</a> and hopes to “be like these people in 10-15 years to be able to help other women.” Who else is she looking ahead to? &#8211; <a href="http://sunnybates.com/" target="_blank">Sunny Bates</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a> to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On finding new focus</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Last year she founded The Eastwood Group, a FinTech company with the mission of developing new technology to impact the payments industry, and made a last minute decision to go through the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Google_Brand_CHI_9B_General-Assembly&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwkeiwBRCzmo-wiKL49pEBEiQAhvGKYasF8Ep5LDQ22YZWdTFrKRe5em2yhN21C9_boLOX1fkaAhEn8P8HAQ" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> UX Design Immersive Program to regain some focus and structure for her product vision.</p>
<p>“I had to make some things happen. If you don’t have a structured process, then you’re lost. I was lost &#8211; all over the place and was working on too many projects. So I decided I needed to learn how to do it the right way.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i>It definitely took some risk, but you have to just jump. I would’ve never thought I’d be as far as I am today. Now I have so much more focus and I understand what I need to get done. I know the type of person I need to be and I’m excited for the next 10 years.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You can find Elizabeth at <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">, lending her expertise to clients downtown, attending tech events, and speaking on the future of payments.”</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Rose Afriyie, Genevieve Nielsen, Marina Goldshteyn<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Technology that simplifies the screening process for public assistance programs.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://www.mrelief.com/">http://www.mrelief.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/mrelief_form">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Interview Date</strong>: July 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_711" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/portrait-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-711" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/portrait-4-300x288.jpg" alt="Rose Afriyie, mRelief" width="300" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rose Afriyie, <a href="http://mrelief.com/">mRelief</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Rose Afriyie is a founder, a technologist, an activist, a writer. She is part of an all-women trio of co-founders that met and joined forces at the<a href="http://www.starterleague.com/"> Starter League</a> to start<a href="http://www.mrelief.com/"> mRelief</a>, a company whose mission is to “fix the broken American welfare system that leaves vulnerable people without access to available public assistance.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On simplifying the process</span></strong><strong>:</strong><br />
One of the biggest barriers in the welfare application process is how much time it takes. Rose used to carry around the standard food stamps application to help drive this point home to people who had not seen it before &#8211; “It’s 18 pages long.”</p>
<p>mRelief currently focuses on simplifying the qualifying process. They start with a global screening form on the first page of their website that is only 5 questions long, and currently screens for<a href="http://www.mrelief.com/programs"> 8 different programs</a> at once. When mRelief partnered with the King Community Center to pilot their screening process, the results showed that they reduced the assisted application time from an average of 16 minutes to 4 minutes, a 75% decrease. Using this simplified screening process as an entry point, can result in huge time savings for applicants who don’t have that much time. “Almost 3/4 of American who are on a public benefits program are members of working families,” and many of the welfare offices are only open during standard working hours.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On increasing discovery and awareness</span></strong>:<br />
In addition to improving the application process in itself, “mRelief is advancing and increasing transparency, visibility and awareness around the assistance criteria. We’re trying to create awareness about what solves your problem. There may be a local resource, but you just don’t know about it. You might just need food for that week or month, and the<a href="http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/site/PageServer"> Chicago Food Depository</a> has multiple food pantry sites all over the city. If you already know that you’re ineligible for food stamps, finding the closest food pantry might be a better use of your time.” The website offers food pantry referrals through a partnership with <a href="http://purplebinder.com/">Purple Binder</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On extending reach and sustaining impact</span></strong><strong>:</strong><br />
The mRelief screening can be done via the website or text message. “For many low income families there may not be a computer at home, and not everyone has the same literacy to do research on government eligibility. Thinking through how to replicate the paper and web forms via text messaging has benefitted lower income families. People using the text messaging service make an average of $150 less per hour than the people we are reaching online.”</p>
<p>In addition to developing the technology itself, mRelief focuses on building the right partnerships to make an impact within the welfare network. They have integrated with community centers that are run by the<a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss/supp_info/community_servicecenterlocations.html"> Department of Family and Support Services</a>, such as the King, Garfield and North Area community centers in Chicago; and partnered with Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s<a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/#overview"> Innovation Delivery Team</a> to launch the pilot last year.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s not enough to have a one app wonder. You have to build an institution, a network of people who are willing to look ahead at where this is going to be for folks in the future. When I think of innovation, I think of institutions that have been built that can lead to more long-term changes.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On her journey</span></strong>:<br />
“This was something that I think was lurking around in the background without me noticing it. In my own personal life, I’m the product of public assistance programs. I was raised in the<a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/bronxgunhillhouses.shtml"> Gun Hill Housing Projects</a> in Bronx, New York on Magenta Street. I had<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic"> WIC</a> in my family. It’s something that you don’t really understand until you’re older. Having some of this assistance was critical to my family.”</p>
<p>Rose believes that benefiting from these types of programs helped her stay on track and opened up opportunities like college and interning at the White House where she took further interest in policy, programs, and learning how to take a macro-level concept and “bring it to back to the everyday person through technology.”</p>
<p>She cites three “catalytic”motivators that have accelerated her evolution and pursuit of mRelief:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1 &#8211; <a href="http://chihacknight.org/">Open Government Hack Night at 1871</a></strong>: The founding trio began attending the weekly hack night while they were students at the<a href="http://www.starterleague.com/"> Starter League</a>. “Open Government Hack Night created a space where government people could connect with people like me who are interested in learning how to code, have a policy background and personal experiences that make these problems really relevant &#8211; that made me willing to put my skin in the game, and willing to go hard. The mayor’s office came and stated that this was a problem, and within a week we had built a prototype.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2 &#8211; <a href="http://byp100.org/">Black Youth Project 100:</a></strong> Rose is a National Membership Chair of BYP100, an “activist member-based organization of Black 18-35 year olds, dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people.”  During a retreat brainstorming session on pain points and problem solving, “it was unanimous around the room that the humiliation that people experience through public assistance was one of the biggest issues and challenges. It’s something that stayed with me &#8211; there is pain around having to ask for help and being unsure how to get it.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3 &#8211; Carrying a torch</strong> &#8211; “It’s about carrying a torch. There’s an awesome and robust history of advocates who found a home in social services. I like to consider myself someone who is emerging in that space and really trying to &#8211; through the lens of tech, gender, and policy &#8211; solve these broken parts of the system.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On other disrupters in the public service space</span></strong>:<br />
“I have to say this &#8211; People say government is slow and bureaucratic, but I really love the innovation delivery teams that are thinking through how to problem solve within government. I really think that<a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/"> Bloomberg Philanthropies</a> has knocked it out of the park. And<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"> 18F</a> is hella dope, right? In terms of public benefits eligibility,<a href="https://www.gov.uk/"> the UK</a> knocks my socks off. And<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyfaustino"> Rey Faustino</a> of<a href="https://www.1deg.org/"> One Degree</a> is the real deal.”</p>
<hr />
<p>When asked about what she wants to contribute to the dialogue on minorities and women in tech and entrepreneurship, she keeps it simple,­ “This is for you too.”</p>

<div id="attachment_708" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portrait.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-708" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portrait-300x288.jpg" alt="Julie Schumacher, Well Turned Words" width="300" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Julie Schumacher, <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Julie Schumacher is a writer, teacher, community organizer, mother, wife, traveler. She is the owner of <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a>, her own writing studio, and the co-founder of <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth Chicago</a>, “an organization focused on creating intentional events that celebrate community and connect people.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On going from teacher to writer and business owner:</span></strong><br />
Julie was a teacher for 10 years and fully expected that she would be a teacher for her entire career. She loved teaching; she had tenure; she loved making an impact on her students. “Still, I felt like there were other things that I could do.”</p>
<p>She took an extended maternity leave when she had her daughter and did some work for her husband, an independent web developer. “I was terrible at it.” However, from that, came the idea of Julie using her writing background to help with copy editing for some of her husband’s clients, creative friends, and collaborators. She ended up spending the last few months of her maternity leave creating a portfolio of her writing samples and launched her writing business, <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a>.</p>
<p>“I learned that there are really different types of writing and that you can leverage and differentiate yourself with whatever background you have. I am a good facilitator, researcher and community builder.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s been incredible. I still can’t believe I get to be a writer. It’s a total thrill.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On being creative</span></strong>:<br />
“At Forth, we focus on creative entrepreneurs. Does that only mean people who are doing photography, writing or design? &#8211; No. It is more about a mindset and an approach to your work versus the product. You can have a creative approach to how you model your business.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“People in all walks of life who are thoughtfully engaged in how they do their work and how they’re producing are being creative. There are more jobs now that put the word ‘creative’ in front of it &#8211; which opens people up to putting their own stamp on it, doing it in a different way, or thinking about it across disciplines and pursuits.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On building women-centric community:</span></strong><br />
Julie is and has been active in multiple community organizations, many of which are women-centric. Her primary “side hustle” is <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth Chicago</a>, a women-focused organization started in 2012 by three creative and entrepreneurial women.</p>
<p>There’s a part of Julie that feels hesitant about excluding men. “I think guys are great!” But she knows that “the challenges that women face, the work that we do, the way that we do it, and the relationships that come out of it are unique. Discussing that unique space that we occupy as independent creators and entrepreneurs was something that the three of us felt really hungry for, and we’ve learned from the response to Forth that we weren’t the only women who felt that way.”</p>
<p>“There is a special way that women work and interact with one another. The entrepreneur community allows that to flourish. Forth allows me to write and to engage in creative conversation with people doing all types of things. There’s also hugging at Forth. There’s not a lot of hugging in copy writing.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On side-stepping stereotypes and cliches:</span></strong><br />
“It is so interesting to see the way in which the women of <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth</a> collaborate and share resources. So often the public conversation is about women being horrible to each other. I’m excited that more and more I’m seeing people not just fight against those stereotypes, but just side step them completely. It is like they’re saying, ‘ I’m too busy mapping out my destiny and building other women up to have time to prove that I’m disproving the stereotype.’ I love that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Throw your shoulde</strong><strong>rs back, and step into the person that you are.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Julie tries not to engage or over think the “can women have it all?” conversation, but is also mindful that she has a “great partner who is a feminist, who is thoughtful, who believes in me as a person- I’m privileged to be in that position. There is a group of women who are 5-7 years younger and will soon be moving into the space of creative entrepreneurship and parenthood; and I want to lead by example for them.”</p>
<hr />
<p>You can find <a href="http://wemadethisourselves.com/">Julie and her family</a> taking their summer working sabbatical this year in Christchurch, New Zealand. One of her fondest book experiences is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitterbug_Perfume">Jitterbug Perfume</a> by Tom Robbins, partly due to this resonating quote: “Perhaps the most terrible (or wonderful) thing that can happen to an imaginative youth, aside from the curse (or blessing) of imagination itself, is to be exposed without preparation to the life outside his or her own sphere &#8211; the sudden revelation that there is a there out there.”</p>

<b>Company Description</b>: Responsible, transparent, ethical travel volunteer exchanges<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="http://www.unearththeworld.com/">http://www.unearththeworld.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/unearththeworld">Twitter</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: April 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_636" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Kathryn-Pisco-final-web.jpg"><img class="wp-image-636 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Kathryn-Pisco-final-web-262x300.jpg" alt="Kathryn Pisco, Unearth the World" width="262" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kathy Pisco, <a href="http://unearththeworld.com/">Unearth the World</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose</a></p></div>
<p>Kathryn Pisco is the founder of Unearth the World, a social enterprise partnering internationally with community-driven non-profits to provide transparent and ethical volunteer exchanges. She believes in servant leadership and approaching cultural exchanges with an attitude of learning and humility. She aims to provide individuals preparation and training, impactful experiences and sustainable life changes through volunteer exchanges around the world.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On leaving corporate America</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Kathryn and her husband, Mike, both had satisfying and successful careers in medical device sales. They’d had casual cocktail conversations about taking some time off to travel and even had some savings allocated for possibly getting their MBAs &#8211; but no real plans to execute. “We’d always taken the traditional path in life- college, jobs, marriage, a house. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it was all we knew.”</p>
<p>They were inspired to action after meeting a friend of a friend who was quitting his job and taking his entire family (with kids) to travel for a year. As an exercise, they began outlining what it might look like if they took a similar plunge.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The more we planned it, the more doable it seemed. It got to a point where I couldn’t imagine not going anymore.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On transitioning from volunteer to business owner</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Going into the trip, Kathryn didn’t intend to start a business afterwards.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“We did five different volunteer projects and the first three were through a volunteer placement company because we didn’t know how to go about it ourselves. That was when we started realizing some of the problems in the volunteer travel industry &#8211; lack of financial transparency, lack of training, and worse, was that a lot of the projects were kind of helpful, but mostly there for Western tourists. The next two projects we found on our own. They were much more impactful because they were community-driven and had sustainability built in. I realized I wasn’t that excited about going back to my old job and all I could think about was improving volunteer travel.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I felt like we could do it better. I gained so much confidence along the trips that made me feel like I could do it. Worst case scenario &#8211; it doesn’t work out, but at least we tried.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On unique challenges in the volunteer travel industry</b></span><b>:</b><br />
“I think we face all the same challenges that any startup does, but what I didn’t anticipate was how controversial volunteer travel is. If you google it, you’re more likely to find negative articles versus positive ones. My challenge has been executing in a crowded and controversial space, and showing people in a minute or two how we’re different &#8211; without a lot of marketing dollars. ”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Besides being more affordable, transparent, and offering more effective training and skill-based volunteer pairing, Kathryn says one of their important and unique offerings is managing the full pre, during, AND post experience for the volunteer.</p>
<p>“If you just send someone abroad you hope that they have a good experience. But if you train, help, reflect with, and support them when they get home, then it’s more likely that the experience is not just short term and will pair into their normal life, and back into our international non-profits. One of my ultimate goals is to have a robust network for travelers to plug into after they come home.” Kathryn goes through a post-trip reflection and coaching session with each individual where they create plans on how they want to incorporate their learnings into their lives.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On how it’s changed her life</b>:</span><br />
Besides the huge decision of switching careers and starting her own business, Kathryn thinks the other life-changes after traveling and volunteering for a year are more nuanced.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“There are shifts in how I look at things. I am more able to let things roll off my back and not worry about it. Just know that you do everything you can and sometimes the best things happen when you don’t plan.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some of it creeps back in when you come back, but I definitely noticed an ability to better deal with stress and anxiety, and not sweat the small stuff. I think I’ve also become more tolerant of people and more careful of where I spend my money.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Without hesitation, Kathryn says the best part of a volunteer exchange is the people. “The people we’ve met along the way have been so inspiring. I’m working harder now than I ever did, but it’s worth it. The highs are so much better.” To learn more, you can watch Unearth the World&#8217;s recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvYW8Ef_2YA">Technori pitch</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Hillary Sawchuk<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: An online publication that sits down with the most interesting and influential celebrities, artists, athletes and industry leaders one drink at a time.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://adrinkwith.com/" target="_blank">http://adrinkwith.com/</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adrinkwith" target="_blank">Twitter</a>; <a href="https://instagram.com/adrinkwith/" target="_blank">Instagram</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: March 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_630" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sawchuk-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-630" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sawchuk-2-300x300.jpg" alt="Hillary Sawchuk, A Drink With" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hillary Sawchuk, <a href="http://adrinkwith.com/">A Drink With</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Hillary Sawchuk is the founder and CEO of A Drink With, an online publication that sits down with the most interesting and influential celebrities, artists, athletes and industry leaders one drink at a time. To date, she’s interviewed over 200 individuals including celebrities such as John Legend, Common, Aaron Paul and Daymond John; and has worked with creative partners like Jim Beam, Acura, and most recently, Virgin Hotels. She is building her internet publication one reader at a time, one interview at a time and one drink at a time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On starting out</strong></span>:<br />
If you check out the site now, you’ll see a sleek, light, modern web page. &#8220;We really want our readers to feel like a fly on the wall, and as part of the conversation. We’re really into the photography and we want it to look artsy and feel like a nice magazine.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“At the beginning, I didn’t know how to buy a domain name; I didn’t know what Tumblr was; I didn’t know what WordPress was. Thank goodness I had a friend, Anthony, who told me I could create a blog for free on WordPress! Then, the spare $250 I had went towards a logo and that just seemed like so much money at the time. Thank goodness for WordPress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the site has gone through two major redesigns and Hillary is already visualizing the site’s next face lift. “It’s always a work in progress.” She reminisces jokingly about how at the beginning, before she learned more about web design, she told her web designer that she wanted to use Beyonce’s website as a model &#8211; turns out Beyonce’s web design budget is pretty big… but it’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On making it a business</strong></span>:<br />
Since the inception, Hillary knew she wanted to turn A Drink With into a business. Originally, they conceptualized a more traditional ad model to make revenue. Luckily, after watching an episode of Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee​, she was inspired when she noticed that Accura was the sponsor of the series episode.“We definitely didn’t even realize that was a thing!” As a result,[because Acura is a sponsor of the Sundance Film Festival] they reached out to Acura and pitched an <a href="http://adrinkwith.com/acura/" target="_blank">interview series</a> featuring the Sundance Film Festival&#8217;s actors, directors and producers in attendance.</p>
<p>With every sponsorship that Hillary lands for A Drink With, she gets to work with the sponsoring brand’s creative team and create custom content for their brand, with no traditional web ads. In 2015, A Drink With will be doing one interview a month at Chicago’s Virgin Hotel which you can see on the A Drink With site or on the <a href="http://virginhotels.com/step-inside/" target="_blank">Virgin Hotel Blog.</a> “It’s really fun to collaborate with brands that align with what we’re doing.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On what it is really about</strong></span>:<br />
Hillary has the opportunity to interview influential celebrities at the international, national, and local level. Her dream is “to have a presence in every city, and to get to know the up and coming talent and people behind your favorite bars and restaurants.” Even with growing access to big-time celebrities, Hillary always wants to make room to feature the people behind local brands in a city.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That’s how we started here in Chicago. There are so many inspiring stories out there that aren’t just from celebrities. Don’t get me wrong &#8211; I still think it’s awesome to talk to celebrities, but no one is off limits. If someone has a great story that someone else can take something from, and learn something from, that encourages them to follow their own dream &#8211; that’s what we’re really all about.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Looking back, Hillary believes that &#8220;everything happens for a reason. I feel like I had to go through some of the lessons I’ve learned along the way so that I can apply them the rest of my life.&#8221; Look for Hillary having drinks with all the cool kids at the Virgin Hotel Chicago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Riana Lynn<br />
<b>Company Description:</b> Technology platform that uses big data and small business user profiles to link food distributors, local farms and specialty food manufacturers with wholesale food buyers.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>:<a href="http://thefoodtrace.com/"> http://thefoodtrace.com/</a>;<a href="https://twitter.com/trace_food"> Twitter</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: February 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_589" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Riana-Lynn-2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-589" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Riana-Lynn-2-300x300.png" alt="Riana Lynn, Food Trace" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Riana Lynn, <a href="http://thefoodtrace.com/">FoodTrace</a><br />Art by <a href="http://nicklacke.tumblr.com/">Nick Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Riana Lynn is the CEO and Founder of FoodTrace, a software company that provides digital discovery and bridges the path between businesses to increase revenue opportunities for local food buyers (e.g, restaurants, grocery stores) looking for distributors, farms, and artisans. The software suite provides tools that improve operations by reporting ingredients, trends, and customer marketing to increase transparency of the resulting sourcing activities. She believes that technology is the answer to improving food access, health, and building a stronger local farming and food community.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On a life full of inspirations</b></span>:<br />
She was always inspired by her own family’s businesses and personal relationships with food. Her grandmother was an urban farmer in Evanston and taught Riana how to garden early on. “It was really impactful because it taught me about sustainability and decreasing food waste.” Her grandfather was a meat distributor and taught her how to hunt and took her to local markets where he sold his products. “It really changed my perspective on eating fresh and local; and the impact small farmers and artisans can have in their local community.”</p>
<p>When she was a teenager, she began to take notice and interest in internet businesses and the growth of e-commerce; and later in college, she taught herself how to code. “I started college the same year that Facebook started. To see a company like that grow and connect people was inspiring.”</p>
<p>Riana knew that she wanted to make an impact in food and health and guided her education and professional experiences with that in mind. She holds B.S. and Masters degrees in Biology, Chemistry and Public Health.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting to FoodTrace</b></span>:<br />
Her passion for technology, food and health continued to shape her projects and business pursuits after school. She had a series of interesting opportunities to get involved in government and health policy organizations, including a stint at the First Lady’s White House Kitchen Garden.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“All these experiences really molded me into understanding that there are solutions to improve access to food. However, I felt that my calling was to do something more agile and flexible than working in the government and hospital systems.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Riana wanted to use technology to create solutions faster. She began a consulting business that focused on e-commerce and digital strategies for local food artisans and had the early features of FoodTrace.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Quality sourcing and marketing your sourcing activities is very valuable for businesses. You’re not only bringing in good products and building relationships with vendors, but you’re able to share these activities with your customers who value more information and more choice on the kind of product and its background.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>She got noticed by the<a href="http://www.cnbcprime.com/the-profit/"> CNBC TV show, The Profit</a> through one of her consulting clients. Her consulting business was acquired in-house by the show host for the associated Investment Holdings group. Riana decided to continue pursuing her vision with the FoodTrace product concept after the acquisition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On learning how to code</b></span>:<br />
“It takes time. You can take classes that are accelerated, but just testing out different platforms and languages a couple hours a day or a week can get you a long way.”</p>
<p>For founders who don’t have any coding knowledge, she suggests that you should acquire some basic knowledge and a mentor who can help you navigate the space.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“If you’re an entrepreneur, you should try to learn it on a basic level so that you can understand how to communicate with people who can take your company to the next level. Every company is tech-enabled now.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On passion and appetite</b></span>:<br />
Riana believes the two most important traits for success are passion and appetite.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“You just need to be consuming all the time. If you don’t have an appetite for continuing to grow and learning all the tools that are making businesses better, then it’s going to be hard to survive. If you really find a project that you are passionate about, I think the appetite will develop because you really want to impact that area and see your brain child grow. If it’s not there, then you’re probably not passionate enough about that issue or subject. The passion drives that appetite. If you don’t feel it, you might be misaligned about what you think you’re passionate about.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what’s most important for women in tech</b></span>:<br />
“Definitely community. I’ve learned so much from people and have a sisterhood of support to learn from. Sharing your knowledge and resources is very valuable. I think the biggest struggle right now is around capital, but I think we can join together to figure out how to raise capital more collectively.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have to be more collaborative than our counterparts &#8211; even if we’re competing for the same pot of money. If we share, then we’ll all have more success.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what else she’s learned along the way</b></span>:<br />
“Don’t schedule too much stuff. You have to wake up earlier. You have to do work on the weekends. And you also have to drink wine and whiskey with your friends. You have to celebrate the small things. You have to relax with your family.”</p>
<hr />
<p>At the time of the interview, FoodTrace was currently in beta and planning to fully launch in the spring. You can find Riana eating at<a href="http://rasdashenchicago.com/"> Ras Dashen</a> restaurant, local taquerias and anywhere with good brussel sprouts, fresh fruit, great spices and hand crafted cocktails. She loves the Edgewater Farmers Market in Chicago, but recommends that you take a Saturday trip out to Madison, WI some time to experience the the Madison Farmers Market at Capitol Square.</p>
<p>In March 2015, Google &#8211; <a href="http://www.code2040.org/">Code2040</a> announced that Riana was one of 3 individuals chosen for their inaugural class of <a href="http://www.code2040.org/news/2015/3/16/announcing-our-first-class-of-code2040-entrepreneurs-in-residence">Entrepreneurs in Residence</a>.</p>

<p>Sarah Press is the Co-founder and CEO of Project Fixup. She has always been passionate about entrepreneurship and bringing people together. She believes in “getting offline as quickly as possible” to help people form meaningful relationships in their busy lives.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting started as an entrepreneur</b></span>:<br />
In college at UNC Chapel Hill, Sarah often fell asleep in her dorm lounge. In the morning, the dorm staff used to come by and wake her up to remind her to get up and go to class. As a result, she formed relationships with the staff and wanted to help them out. She created an online form that connected the staff with university students who were interested in tutoring their kids. The product and concept were simple, but being able to create something that added value to people she cared about was “inspiring and empowering”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the path to Project Fixup</b></span>:<br />
Sarah’s first startup was Communiteach, a peer-to-peer learning platform to help neighbors and friends learn from each other. After a period of time, she realized that though she found the mission rewarding, finding peer-to-peer learning opportunities just wasn’t a big enough pain point in peoples’ lives. She pivoted her thinking and decided to bring people together for a different purpose &#8211; dating.</p>
<p>“Project Fixup had a similar soul to Communiteach because it was still based off recognizing that people are really busy, but really benefit from meeting each other. Instead of doing it for learning, it was doing it for dating. People like to learn from their neighbors, but if you’re single you REALLY want to meet people with similar interests”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On Tech Stars and funding</b></span><b>:</b><br />
In 2013, Project Fixup was selected to be in the inaugural class of <a href="http://www.techstars.com/">Tech Stars</a>. They had bootstrapped the year prior and continue to keep their funding small for the time being. Outside of the ~$100K seed investment that comes with Tech Stars, Project Fixup has only taken investment from one additional angel investor.</p>
<p>“When you’re trying to do too many things at once with a small team &#8211; figure out your product, figure out your marketing, figure out your investment &#8211; you’re not going to be able to do any of them effectively. Initially after Tech Stars we were having several conversations with funders, but it just wasn’t really the right time because we were still trying to figure out our core product pieces. So we decided to take a step back and figure out how we can expand to other cities first.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“You can focus on one of those things, maybe two, but not all three. Feel comfortable saying ‘no’ to some opportunities and ‘no’ to some follow-ups because you just can’t be focusing on too many different avenues.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On finding a technical co-founder</b></span>:<br />
Sarah’s current co-founder and CTO is Jason Skicewicz. They spent 2 months working together on Project Fixup and trying out their relationship before making the decision to be co-founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The world has really evolved in the past few years, so people shouldn’t feel like they can’t accomplish SOMETHING without a CTO. There’s no excuse to at least not start validating your idea and making progress. That gives you flexibility to get to know people better so that you know you’re going to be a dynamic team with a shared vision.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah lists that co-founders should have 1) passion 2) entrepreneurship 3) complimentary skill sets 4) shared vision 5) shared style.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On dating online and offline</b></span><b>:</b><br />
The idea behind Project Fixup is that you spend as little time online as possible. Project Fixup does the work for you and sets you up on an in-person date. Sarah aims to “offer a service where you can still meet people and hit it off without all the other work involved in traditional online dating sites.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“We think the proper mix of online and offline is to get offline as quickly as possible. People aren’t profiles &#8211; they’re very different. A person having a conversation is different than a text you send on <a href="http://www.gotinder.com/">Tinder</a>. People make a lot of assumptions based on these artificial ways of communicating that don&#8217;t really align in person.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah talks about how even offline, assumptions and impressions can be off. “We do a post date review after each date, so sometimes we get to see how people have very different interpretations of how a date went. In one case, the girl really liked the guy, had a really great time and was very excited about him. But then, the guy thought she had no interest in him. Usually we don’t follow-up directly, but sometimes we want to give a little nudge.”</p>
<p>“Dating is hard! Sometimes people don’t realize the signals that they give off.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On evolving as an entrepreneur</b></span><b>:</b><br />
“At the beginning, I thought that as soon as you focus on something and if you believe in it enough it will come true. I was very hopeful and optimistic and I still am. But I’ve learned that entrepreneurship is a process. Even for ideas that don’t hit a home run out of the park &#8211; just the fact that you’re bringing something into existence that can add value to people is really rewarding. Thousands of people signed up to Communiteach and had the opportunity to connect and learn from their neighbors. And even though the full platform doesn&#8217;t’ exist anymore, the <a href="http://learnapaloozachi.com/">Learnapalooza</a> festival came out of Communiteach. It’s an official nonprofit with a team that is still pushing on it. I’ve learned that that has its own types of rewards.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I love launching my own startups, but I’ve also learned that I just love being entrepreneurial in general.”</p></blockquote>

<b>Company Description</b>: Pivotal Production is a marketing strategy firm that combines traditional and new media<br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: January 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_461" style="width: 284px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DOWNEY2-sq.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-461" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DOWNEY2-sq-274x300.jpg" alt="Shannon Downey, Pivotal Production" width="274" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shannon Downey, <a href="http://www.pivotalchicago.com/">Pivotal Production</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Shannon Downey is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://www.pivotalchicago.com/" target="_blank">Pivotal Production</a>, a marketing strategy firm. She is also the creator of <a href="http://badasscrossstitch.com/" target="_blank">Badass Cross Stitch</a> and the blogger behind <a href="http://www.seriouslybadasswomen.com/" target="_blank">Seriously Badass Women</a>. She believes in being badass at everything she does &#8211; running her own business, advocating for women and diversity, giving back to the community, living and acting sustainably and in seeking balance between the digital and analog worlds.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On how she got to today</strong></span>:<br />
Shannon didn’t know she would end up running her own business. She has a BA in Anthropology and a MS in Recreation Administration. She worked in e-commerce and later taught middle school with Teach for America. She began freelancing through a larger event planning company after graduate school and realized that she really enjoyed it, but wanted to run events that were less wasteful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“I wanted to do things more sustainably. I didn’t want to participate in the reckless wasting that I saw in the event industry. So I<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>thought, ‘Let me do what I am doing, but do it on my own in a more sustainable way.’  When I started out, people thought I was mental.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On balancing life between digital and analog</strong></span>:<br />
When I asked Shannon about how she handles balancing digital versus analog activity in her life, she laughs and points to all the quirky stitched crafts in her office that represent her <a href="http://badasscrossstitch.com/" target="_blank">Badass Cross Stitch</a> brand and community.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Digital burnout is very real. The struggle is real.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So she started embroidering and stitching again, something that she used to do as a kid. “The more that I do it, the more I feel like it’s all I want to do &#8211; in this really powerful way.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The irony is not lost on me that I’m doing this analog to get away from the digital. But then I have to share it on the digital side to create this community that will eventually turn into an actual gathering of folks to create analog work. <span style="color: #000000;">But </span>I think it’s a beautiful testament to where balance can be found. I’m attempting to help people put down their devices and go make things because it uses such a different part of your spirit and your brain and I feel like we’re losing that a lot.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s all this talk about work/life balance. But I think we’re more in need of digital/analog balance.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On women and diversity in business and tech</strong></span>:<br />
“I feel intentionality is what will drive actual change. For people in a place of privilege &#8211; if you are not actively thinking about your privilege, then you are just benefiting from your privilege thinking that everyone else is just too <span style="color: #000000;">lazy</span> to do what you did. So sometimes the first step <span style="color: #000000;">to privilege-recognition</span> is just thinking, ‘Well, we need a woman.’</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know what? &#8211; That’s fine. I’ll be your woman, I’ll be your gay. But I know that’s what you’re thinking because it’s so obvious. I know going in what it is, and I know coming out of it what it will be &#8211; and hopefully it will be a transformation. Trust that along the way I will be educating you in a positive and proactive way.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the word ‘Badass’</strong></span>:<br />
“I think it’s so great! People have used that word on me my whole life &#8211; sometimes good and sometimes not. But, I always took it as a massive badge of honor. I don’t care if you were trying to insult me! It’s now a sub-brand that I love. Badass everything!”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Own your badassery and go do something.”</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“When you hear people talk about great leaders, especially male ones, they’re using words like ‘dynamo’, ‘change maker’, ‘influencer’ &#8211; words that are both powerful and positive. These words should be used on women too. Often, softer adjectives are used to describe women instead. I find myself around powerful women and I think they’re ‘badass’”. (You can check out some of Shannon’s badass women at <a href="http://www.seriouslybadasswomen.com/" target="_blank">seriouslybadasswomen.com</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On taking risks</strong></span>:<br />
“I think we get really comfortable in the types of risks that we’re into. If you’re comfortable starting a business, then you’re comfortable with the risk of starting a business. There are so many different types of risks in this world, and I like to think of my life as an adventure. I like to make sure I’m constantly on an adventure and that equals taking risks in different ways. I want to always be doing something that’s a little bit scary to me. If it’s not a little bit scary then it’s not a risk.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The idea of creating art and putting it out there was uncomfortable for me. So I forced myself to do it. And the more <span style="color: #000000;">I do it, the more </span>I love it.”<img class="ajT" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" alt="" /></p>
<div class="adL">
<div class="im">
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“I want everyone to live life as an adventure and that means do crazy shit. What great stories you get and what great experiences! I’ve lived 100 lives already, and I can’t wait to live 100 more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">What are some of Shannon’s tips for successfully leveraging the digital marketing world? “People want to connect over positive things. You want to be a producer of positivity.” Here are a few of her closing pointers: 1) Stop trying to do everything. 2) Figure out what you actually like doing and be awesome at it. 3) Figure out where your audience is and where they want to connect with you. 4) Get control over your time. 5) Be yourself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s it &#8211; now go be a badass.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Tiffaney Florentine and Kara Albert<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Trodo is a health and wellness company that is creating functional fitness communities through corporate wellness programs, youth programs and league events.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://www.trodo.org/">trodo.org</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trodoboxleague">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/trodoboxleague">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: November 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_332" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tiffaney.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-332" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tiffaney-284x300.jpg" alt="Tiffaney Florentine, Trodo" width="284" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tiffaney Florentine, <a href="https://trodo.org">Trodo</a><br />Art by John Rose of <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose Illustration</a></p></div>
<p>Tiffaney Florentine is a military vet, an American Gladiator contender, a CrossFitter and a certified personal trainer. She has an MBA from The Ohio State University, and has worked for the CIA, Deloitte, Ernst and Young and Gallup. She has mean chops on the athletic field and in the corporate meeting room; and she’s smashing it all together to create and scale functional fitness communities that are accessible, emotionally engaging and life-changing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the evolution of an idea</span>:</strong></p>
<p>While working at Deloitte, Tiffaney tried out and was accepted to be on American Gladiator. “As the show aired, people started coming up to me (asking about fitness). I had 10 times the influence that I had before. TV is a scary thing!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;People started asking me about what to eat and how to workout. I found myself at the center of their life change. This was a turning point. I thought &#8211; how do I drive health and wellness behavior change in a way that is scalable?</em>”</p></blockquote>
<p>With all this in mind, Tiffaney went back to school, got a personal training certification and started working in healthcare consulting at Ernst and Young. She learned that corporate wellness programs were only focused on health risk assessments, biometric screenings and chronic disease management. versus emotionally engaging people to change physical inactivity.</p>
<p>Then, while working at Gallup, she discovered CrossFit. “At Gallup, we quantified human behavior and studied the most emotionally engaged customers. We’d identify the drivers of engagement and replicate them across the customer base. I was fascinated by the intense emotional engagement of CrossFitters and thought, ‘We can study this, learn from it, and change the world by scaling the experience. This is the way to reverse the epidemic of obesity and physical inactivity.’ And that’s the path that led us here.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On starting and expanding</span>:</strong></p>
<p>The first segment of the business she stood up was the Trodo Box League (“box” is lingo for gym) &#8211;  a series of ongoing events for local CrossFit affiliates focusing on community and including events for all fitness levels.  “The league is the foundation that brings our brand to life and has allowed us to develop partnerships and expertise in this space. The end game is reversing the epidemic of physical inactivity and this is the framework to get there. Now we’re working fast and furious to expand into the workplace and youth environment to meet people where they are emotionally and financially.”</p>
<p>Though the Trodo Box League members are all currently Crossfit affiliates and Tiffaney works out at CrossFit gyms herself, she says they are not a CrossFit company or affiliated with CrossFit in any way. “We are our own brand. We pride ourselves on being emotionally accessible to everyone. We study CrossFit because people are emotionally engaged. Members attend an average of 3.75 times per week and they’re seeing incredible results, whereas traditional gyms see fewer than 1 time per week and attendance and results are not key industry metrics.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Getting people to move is all about emotional engagement, not rational incentives. 70% of human decision-making is emotional. We must tend to peoples&#8217; emotional needs to truly change lives.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On mission</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Tiffaney is all about the mission. She believes it is the core of everything that she does and every decision she makes for Trodo. “I had a mentor that told me the most important thing is to have the clearest mission imaginable and everything should revolve around that mission.”</p>
<p>“The team (of Trodo Box League volunteers that help run the events) just oozes the mission. They are so aligned with the mission and they come out to support it. That’s powerful. They are supporting something that’s bigger than me.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;There’s nothing that makes me happier in this world than giving people the opportunity to do something they’re passionate about and to change the lives of others. It’s amazing to see people rally behind a cause that was just an idea a year and half ago.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p>“When we get a meeting with a corporation, the majority of the time companies say they want to decrease healthcare cost and increase productivity. We’re saying we want to make people better.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On having her spouse as her co-founder</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Kara Albert is Tiffaney’s co-founder. She is also her wife and she previously worked at Gallup with her before taking the plunge full-time into Trodo with Tiffaney. “Kara is incredibly talented. I feel that people often start businesses with their partners out of convenience, not because it’s the right talent. Kara is the perfect partner – hands down. She truly has the mind of a strong entrepreneur. She’s incredibly resourceful and can select, inspire and equip the best talent to bring the Trodo mission and strategy to life. Talent-wise we compliment each other really well.</p>
<p>“Of course work/life balance is a struggle and even more challenging because we’re in the same work environment, and then there’s the stress of personal cash flow. Communication gets us through it. We love what we do and we’re truly chasing our dream to change the world…together.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the transition from corporate to startup</strong></span>:</p>
<p>“I’ve never been around any entrepreneurs. I thought about entrepreneurship in grad school but was a too chicken to pursue it at the time. I’ve always supported myself, so I’ve always had a little bit of fear of not having a backup plan. It didn&#8217;t really come to me as a viable option until I was at Gallup. I was in an extremely entrepreneurial role that built my confidence to finally take the plunge. I didn’t know what to expect. I just did it. I knew that I had been through tougher times in life. I trusted that I could be humble enough to ask others for help, to find the right resources and people, and to pull the plug if things weren’t working out.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;If you see a market opportunity and you’re certain you have the resources and experience to bring it to life and change the world, you really have no choice but to give it your all and to see the idea through.”</em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>So what does “Trodo” mean anyways? “Trodo means vulnerability and it&#8217;s all about people putting themselves out there to be vulnerable, to get better as a community.” Trodo Box League currently has 26 participating boxes, 75 volunteers, a reach of ~4400 athletes, and is expanding to build structured, emotionally engaging programs in the workplace and youth environments.</p>

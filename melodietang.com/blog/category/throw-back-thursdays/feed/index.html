<p><i>“You just need to be consuming all the time. If you don’t have an appetite for continuing to grow and learning all the tools that are making businesses better, then it’s going to be hard to survive. If you really find a project that you are passionate about, I think the appetite will develop because you really want to impact that area and see your brain child grow. If it’s not there, then you’re probably not passionate enough about that issue or subject. The passion drives that appetite. If you don’t feel it, you might be misaligned about what you think you’re passionate about.” &#8211; <a title="Riana Lynn, FoodTrace" href="http://belikepeter.com/riana-lynn-food-trace/">Rianna Lynn, FoodTrace</a></i></p>
<p><em>&#8220;What gets me excited is that I can get to a certain point where I have increased my network with the leaders of the world and society, and can create something much larger. I just want to challenge the norm of what people do. I want to create a new way of investing in people – especially those who don’t have the opportunity that I had.&#8221; &#8211; <a title="Dan Novaes, MobileX Labs" href="http://belikepeter.com/dan-novaes-mobilex-labs/">Dan Novaes, MobileX Labs</a></em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t think everyone has to be gluten-free necessarily. People find different things that work for their bodies. I do think that people do better when they eat less sugar and less processed foods. Many times, gluten is accompanied by processed foods and refined sugar. It’s better to say you’re going to eat a diet of simple natural ingredients versus to just be gluten-free.” &#8211; <a title="Katlin Smith, Simple Mills" href="http://belikepeter.com/katlin-smith-simple-mills/">Katlin Smith, Simple Mills</a></em></p>
<p><em>“Most of it is the ride – I don’t know how the ride will end. You have to enjoy the ride because it is one hell of a ride.” &#8211; <a title="Eliad Inbar, Tangiblee" href="http://belikepeter.com/eliad-inbar-tangiblee/">Eliad Inbar, Tangiblee</a></em></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On focus</span></strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the things I learned how to do was focus. I tried to do everything when I started and that’s the wrong thing to do. You have to choose a few things that are really important and then let the rest slide. That would’ve saved me so much time. There are 1000 things you could be doing right now and 3 of them matter. If you just focus on those 3, then you have more time to work …. or go live your life.<span class="im"> &#8211; <a title="Corbett Drummey, Popular Pays" href="http://belikepeter.com/corbett-drummey-popular-pays/">Corbett Drummey, Popular Pays</a></span></p>
<p>“You can focus on one of those things, maybe two, but not all three. Feel comfortable saying ‘no’ to some opportunities and ‘no’ to some follow-ups because you just can’t be focusing on too many different avenues.” &#8211; <a title="Sarah Press, Project Fixup" href="http://belikepeter.com/sarah-press-project-fixup/">Sarah Press, Project Fixup</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On entrepreneurship and startups</strong></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I love startups. I’ve met the smartest and most interesting people, and they do the coolest shit and have the best ethos and culture. You’re based on results. With startups you can’t fake it- you get it right or you fail. It’s not like school where you do homework to please a teacher. Startups are very real. You’re on your own – and that’s the scary part. No one is coming to check in on you.” &#8211; <a title="Corbett Drummey, Popular Pays" href="http://belikepeter.com/corbett-drummey-popular-pays/">Corbett Drummey, Popular Pays</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve learned that entrepreneurship is a process. Even for ideas that don’t hit a home run out of the park – just the fact that you’re bringing something into existence that can add value to people is really rewarding.&#8221; &#8211; <a title="Sarah Press, Project Fixup" href="http://belikepeter.com/sarah-press-project-fixup/">Sarah Press, Project Fixup</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On social impacts</strong></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Doing good is really good business. That’s how we first incorporated it. That’s the honest truth. It’s difficult to do something that is purely altruistic and selfless – but you start to feel really good and it’s become such a huge part of our identity and motivation. It helps me wake up every morning.” &#8211; <a title="Steven Dyme, Flowers for Dreams" href="http://belikepeter.com/steven-dyme-flowers-for-dreams/">Steven Dyme, Flowers for Dreams</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On solving problems</strong></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Don’t be intimidated by what you think is difficult or who you think is too tough or too smart for you. Have confidence in your ability to solve a problem.” &#8211; <a title="Steven Dyme, Flowers for Dreams" href="http://belikepeter.com/steven-dyme-flowers-for-dreams/">Steven Dyme, Flowers for Dreams</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On funding</strong></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can’t tell you if what I’m doing is right or wrong, but I’m doing what I feel is right. We’ve ramped up pretty aggressively. I heard once that when you start accepting funding you have to imagine yourself running as fast as you can towards a brick wall. Right before you hit impact, you hope someone jumps in front of you and helps you hurdle that wall before you have to do it all over again.” &#8211; <a title="Ross Petersen, Blitsy" href="http://belikepeter.com/ross-petersen-blitsy/">Ross Petersen, Blitsy</a></p></blockquote>

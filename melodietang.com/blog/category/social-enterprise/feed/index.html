<p>Shiv Rajendran is a car enthusiast, an engineering enthusiast, and a possibilities enthusiast. After achieving his short-term corporate goals, he realized that none of his passions had any place in his current career trajectory &#8211; so he took off in search of a new one.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On shedding material wealth</b></span>:<br />
In his previous life, Shiv worked at Deloitte. At age 25, he was one of the company’s youngest Senior Consultants in their finance practice. “I wanted to hit six figures before I turned 25. I did that three days after my 25th birthday &#8211; and I really disliked it. I was doing 80 hours of work a week that I didn’t care about.”</p>
<p>During a vacation, he met a guy in the electric car industry, and was really interested in the industry. “I’m a car nut. I’ve raced since I was 15. I was a bus driver when I was getting my master’s degree. I’ve ridden my motorcycle across the US on solo trips.” He decided to sell everything he had except his motorcycle and move to California.</p>
<p>He worked as a director at an electric vehicle start up for a little over a year, but the company closed shop. He knew he didn’t want to go back to a standard full-time job, so he he sold his belongings again and moved into his friend’s garage.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can pretty much survive on $6 a day. It’s not that big of a deal, you just can’t do EVERYTHING. I grew up pretty comfortable, so I just wanted to see what I could do. I have one nice jacket, and just wear it all the time. I didn&#8217;t want to go back to a corporate life unless i was really, really broke &#8211; like less than $100.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the idea for an alternative battery solution</b></span><b>:</b><br />
It was while living in his friend’s garage that he found the time and clarity for Totus Power. A friend of his had moved back to India to start schools that utilized tablets as a way to improve education experiences. The issue was that reliable, safe and affordable power sources were hard to come by in these Indian schools. Shiv began researching solutions for his friend in his spare time and was disappointed with the results.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not a premium market, so not a lot of people care about it. On top of that, it’s not easy. It’s either you use lead acid batteries or Lithium Ion batteries. There’s nothing else. Lead acid batteries are bulky, toxic and have poor shelf life. Lithium Ion batteries are expensive.”</p></blockquote>
<p>From Shiv’s previous experience, he knew that electric car batteries only have about 6-7 years of usage on them before they lose power density and only operate at 70% capacity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For most conventional purposes, the battery is essentially useless and expensive to recycle &#8211; somewhere between 5-10% of the cost of the car. Companies are mandated to recycle the batteries.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“One day, I was listening to music in bed and I literally jumped out of bed and thought, ‘Wait! Why can’t I use these (electric car) batteries?!’” This was in 2013.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On challenges and dedication</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Along his journey, Shiv has been met with both acceptance and rejection. His idea has gained attention and won pitch competitions and he was accepted into the 2014 class of Impact Engine. However, even with all the expressed interest, the struggle to fund a prototype is real. As a solo founder without a US working visa, investor interest has been hard to close.</p>
<p>“We have batteries, engineers, an advisor from Tesla and a customer in Tanzania who wants to launch these batteries across 250 villages where they’re doing massive education projects with tablets. I have all these pieces lined up, but I just need more money.”</p>
<p>Shiv recently returned to Chile, a home to some of his original reception via SeedStars World and Startup Chile, to put all focus into completing his prototype by the end of this year to fill orders.</p>
<p>“I’ve switched back to my 2013 mode and my $6 a day budget and doing paid work on the side. Like I said, I’ll quit when I only have $100 left in my pocket.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Shiv’s dream car is a Pagani Zonda R, but “in this lifetime” he will settle happily for a Subaru BRZ.  He loves the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin">The Adventures of Tin Tin</a>  and is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan’s</a> philosophy of “stepping beyond profits and balance sheets and moving the human race forward” &#8211; maybe by powering education in developing communities.</p>

<strong>Company Description</strong>: Software company that helps organizations connect with civic supporters to raise money, inspire involvement and build community<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://publicgood.com/">https://publicgood.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/publicgood">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: June 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_664" style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jason-kunesh.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-664" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jason-kunesh-263x300.jpg" alt="Jason Kunesh, Public Good" width="263" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jason Kunesh,<a href="https://publicgood.com/"> Public Good</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Jason Kunesh is the co-founder and CEO of Public Good, a software company that helps organizations connect with civic supporters to raise money, inspire involvement and build community. He is passionate about product and technology design, social capital, community, and superheroes &#8211; both the kind that appear in comic books and the unheralded ones that serve our communities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On starting Public Good</b></span>:<br />
Social service has always played a significant role in Jason’s life &#8211; from being adopted as a child, to having a mother who was an active and beloved community volunteer, to joining the Obama re-election campaign’s technology team. The opportunity to work on the Obama campaign came at a time when Jason was examining how he wanted to re-allocate his time and skills to more impactful solutions besides “helping people get to cheaper spa days or flights”.</p>
<p>After the re-election was over, it was time to decide where to go next. The team realized that they wanted to continue what they started and apply their learnings. “It’s really 2.0 for us. We learned a lot of stuff on the campaign about what worked and what didn’t, and how different it was to model community relationships versus business relationships. We’re taking some of the same stuff we learned and applying it in new ways out of the political space and into the non-profit space.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On how technology facilitates social capital</b></span>:<br />
“The big thing is data. That was the biggest thing we tried to solve during the campaign. If we understand that you are the same person that showed up to an event, that engaged with us over Facebook, and came to the phone bank, then we have a much more complete picture of who you are and we can have a better and more respectful conversation with you.”</p>
<p>“There’s all this stuff that you can do (with technology) that is transactional, like donations and fundraising, but there’s additional stuff too. There are all these little things that can be useful &#8211; reading an article, sharing an article, voting, writing a letter &#8211; all these things that you can do. It’s all about how you connect people to realizing that all these little things actually matter, and you can track it.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“When it becomes apparent, it encourages change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Nonprofits are really good at 1:1 interaction, but haven’t been as good at using technology to emulate it. For example, if someone is excited enough to respond, I’m going to respond right away to show that I’m enthusiastic about hearing from them. During the campaign we learned that if someone got back to you in a couple of days, you were 80% more likely to come out and do something. If we waited a week, then you were under 20%. It’s the simple difference of being in the moment and getting excited.”</p>
<p>“The challenge with social impact and social capital work is instead of getting something in return, you are giving something away. To start, if we can at least show enthusiasm that you are part of a community and doing something, then that helps out.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“People who have been doing it a long time will say that they get more out of it than they give away. Once you realize the weird math of volunteerism, then people are hooked and will do stuff.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On design</span>:</b><br />
Jason references the philosophies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams">Dieter Rams</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek">Victor Papanek</a>, and Steve Jobs. He believes that design should provide frictionless solutions, be invisible to the user, and be intentional at every “layer of the onion.”</p>
<p>“I think design is getting into exciting places. In the early 20th century it was products, and then systems that created products, and now it’s about systems. We’re also starting to design behaviors &#8211; which is new. 50 years ago we designed flavors and scents, and now we’re trying to design actual behavior change &#8211; which is exciting.”</p>
<p>“Everybody is a designer and we just don’t realize it. We use tools and the tools are designed to give us super powers. I use this spoon so I can lift up liquid, and this fork to lift up the non-liquid things. These are my solutions. There’s always that idea of context and problem solving, and there’s always more than one tool. But, some are better than others.”</p>
<p>Jason gets a little bit existential as we talk about how design is the space and interaction created between the designer and the user. Then, we think about superheroes and how Batman is invisible, but in a loud way. And he finishes with utilitarian philosophy &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“As a user, you should know nothing of the person that created it. You should know that the object suits your desires and accomplishes your goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what’s exciting:</b></span><br />
“I’m excited that we (designers) have a seat at the table. That wasn’t the case for a long time. When I started 15 years ago, it was about self-definition. You came through the engineering door or the marketing door. There was no design door. Now we have a seat &#8211; so it is about what you do with that power and how do you help early designers figure that power out. You’re not a waiter, you’re a guide.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a fascinating box where you can do whatever you want &#8211; limited only by your skills and your imagination. If you can figure it out, you can do it.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Jason believes Chicago is the place to be for Public Good &#8211; “It’s a civic tech place. It’s a livable international city. It’s pragmatic &#8211; hard working, authentic, roll up our sleeves and get some stuff done. This is where it’s at in terms of nonprofits, foundations and innovation.” <a href="https://twitter.com/publicgood">Follow</a> how <a href="https://publicgood.com/">Public Good</a> is leveraging technology to engage with hundreds of organizations in Chicago and across the US to inspire people to take action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founders</b>: Brian Hill and Andy Brimhall<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: Educational content platform delivered via tablets to jail and prison inmates.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="http://jaileducationsolutions.com/">http://jaileducationsolutions.com/</a> ; <a href="https://twitter.com/jaileducation">Twitter</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: May 2015<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_658" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brian-Hill-final-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-658" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brian-Hill-final-1-284x300.jpg" alt="Brian Hill, Jail Education Solutions" width="284" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brian Hill,<a href="http://jaileducationsolutions.com/"> Jail Education Solutions</a><br />Art by <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose</a></p></div>
<p>Brian Hill is the co-founder of Jail Education Solutions, a social enterprise delivering educational content to jail and prisons via their technology platform, Edovo. He believes in bringing together government and private sector solutions to make large-scale social impacts through patience, adaptation and commitment to mission.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the problems</span>:</b><br />
Brian describes a typical jail as a crowded space with people milling around between sleep and daytime television. “Well no wonder this doesn’t work! We’re not getting any results out of this. There are some brilliant people behind bars &#8211; some that shouldn’t be there and some that should &#8211; and many who are there because of a mistake that many of us have also made in our lives. We have to figure out how to use this important time to help people make changes in their lives. We’re really arresting development. They come out worse off than when they went in.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Incarceration is a serious social issue. We have to figure out what we think corrections are supposed to be and then figure out how we can financially put incentives in place to get it where it should be.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“It really comes down to what Americans see as the purpose of corrections. If the purpose is to promote public safety and get dangerous people off the street, then we’ve got way too many people in jail. If the purpose is to be angry and punish people and screw up their lives, then we’re doing really well. We incarcerate in America more than any other country by far. We have gone off the rails. We are spending far too much money and damaging future generations. We got tougher and tougher on crime but we actually got dumber and dumber.&#8221;<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Brian says that in his perfect world of corrections, out of 100 inmates, he would send 30 to proper mental health care facilities that are better equipped to provide specialized care; 50 would just be allowed to go home with limited monitoring and resources; and the other 20 are the ones we should actually be concerned about.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On why jail?</span>:</b><br />
There are many different aspects of the corrections system, but Jail Education Solutions has chosen to primarily focus on the jail population. Brian explains that jail is an interim pre-trial holding facility which means it has the highest volume and turnover. Apparently Cook County cycles through 70K jail inmates every year.</p>
<p>“That’s just a lot of people that you can reach and touch, and hopefully change their trajectory. In jails, your impact is much broader. A prison is only turning over 10% of their population on an annual basis. From a practical perspective, we’d need a lot more content in prison; and from an impact perspective, we can reach a lot more people in jails.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On monitoring impacts</b></span>:<br />
To monitor and measure changes in the population, Jail Education Solutions studies key drivers that decrease recidivism (a person’s relapse into criminal behavior) such as gains to education and literacy. Less obvious, are behavioral changes, such as increase in optimism, which has a high impact on decision making.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Brian says that the “most effective methodology to change inmate outcomes in the long term and decrease recidivism is through cognitive behavioral therapy” so that inmates can practice going through decision-making scenarios.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“In jail you’re not making real life decisions. We can use the platform to gauge how their decision-making changes over time and how it impacts recidivism and job placement when they get out.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Tracking that kind of progress and outcome takes time. So “in the short term we’re really looking at engagement, user experience and education attainment. It’s still early. It’s an exciting time for us.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the power of the individual</span>:</b><br />
Brian says that some of the problems stem from misconceptions within the general population, but also within the corrections system. “There’s this perception that these people will never change and won’t want to do anything differently.That’s absolutely wrong.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Brian describes how when inmates are given access to their content, without any guidance or direction, they usually gravitate towards the most meaningful content. “They’re going towards parenting, cognitive behavioral therapy, GED, and literacy content. That’s been amazing to see. They went for the meat right away. This is them deciding for themselves. If I could hand select it for them, this is where I’d want them to go.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Because the problem is so challenging, we’ve first focused on giving the power to the individual to make a change. Even with all the cards stacked against them, we do believe in the individual and that they want to make changes when given the opportunity.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On mission</span>:</b><br />
“Our ultimate goal is to help people. These are our community members living in a different location for a short time. They’re coming home to us in our neighborhoods.”</p>
<blockquote><p> “Our business works in corrections, but it also works post-corrections. Our business does not depend upon people being in jail, and that’s very important. We want to make sure our incentives are never aligned with having more people in jail.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“There were opportunities for us to go after faster money that would&#8217;ve jeopardized our mission, but we didn’t.  We are now highly respected and seen as a leader. People trust us.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Brian understands the reality and the breadth of the problem he’s gotten involved in, but is hopeful about the positive  impacts they’ve already been able to make in the system. “Government moves slowly; jails move slower. But when we turn on a tablet in a facility we make history because we&#8217;ve put more content in the hand of an inmate than has ever been available.&#8221;</p>

<b>Date of Interview</b>: April 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_636" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Kathryn-Pisco-final-web.jpg"><img class="wp-image-636 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Kathryn-Pisco-final-web-262x300.jpg" alt="Kathryn Pisco, Unearth the World" width="262" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kathy Pisco, <a href="http://unearththeworld.com/">Unearth the World</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose</a></p></div>
<p>Kathryn Pisco is the founder of Unearth the World, a social enterprise partnering internationally with community-driven non-profits to provide transparent and ethical volunteer exchanges. She believes in servant leadership and approaching cultural exchanges with an attitude of learning and humility. She aims to provide individuals preparation and training, impactful experiences and sustainable life changes through volunteer exchanges around the world.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On leaving corporate America</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Kathryn and her husband, Mike, both had satisfying and successful careers in medical device sales. They’d had casual cocktail conversations about taking some time off to travel and even had some savings allocated for possibly getting their MBAs &#8211; but no real plans to execute. “We’d always taken the traditional path in life- college, jobs, marriage, a house. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it was all we knew.”</p>
<p>They were inspired to action after meeting a friend of a friend who was quitting his job and taking his entire family (with kids) to travel for a year. As an exercise, they began outlining what it might look like if they took a similar plunge.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The more we planned it, the more doable it seemed. It got to a point where I couldn’t imagine not going anymore.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On transitioning from volunteer to business owner</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Going into the trip, Kathryn didn’t intend to start a business afterwards.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“We did five different volunteer projects and the first three were through a volunteer placement company because we didn’t know how to go about it ourselves. That was when we started realizing some of the problems in the volunteer travel industry &#8211; lack of financial transparency, lack of training, and worse, was that a lot of the projects were kind of helpful, but mostly there for Western tourists. The next two projects we found on our own. They were much more impactful because they were community-driven and had sustainability built in. I realized I wasn’t that excited about going back to my old job and all I could think about was improving volunteer travel.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I felt like we could do it better. I gained so much confidence along the trips that made me feel like I could do it. Worst case scenario &#8211; it doesn’t work out, but at least we tried.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On unique challenges in the volunteer travel industry</b></span><b>:</b><br />
“I think we face all the same challenges that any startup does, but what I didn’t anticipate was how controversial volunteer travel is. If you google it, you’re more likely to find negative articles versus positive ones. My challenge has been executing in a crowded and controversial space, and showing people in a minute or two how we’re different &#8211; without a lot of marketing dollars. ”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Besides being more affordable, transparent, and offering more effective training and skill-based volunteer pairing, Kathryn says one of their important and unique offerings is managing the full pre, during, AND post experience for the volunteer.</p>
<p>“If you just send someone abroad you hope that they have a good experience. But if you train, help, reflect with, and support them when they get home, then it’s more likely that the experience is not just short term and will pair into their normal life, and back into our international non-profits. One of my ultimate goals is to have a robust network for travelers to plug into after they come home.” Kathryn goes through a post-trip reflection and coaching session with each individual where they create plans on how they want to incorporate their learnings into their lives.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On how it’s changed her life</b>:</span><br />
Besides the huge decision of switching careers and starting her own business, Kathryn thinks the other life-changes after traveling and volunteering for a year are more nuanced.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“There are shifts in how I look at things. I am more able to let things roll off my back and not worry about it. Just know that you do everything you can and sometimes the best things happen when you don’t plan.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some of it creeps back in when you come back, but I definitely noticed an ability to better deal with stress and anxiety, and not sweat the small stuff. I think I’ve also become more tolerant of people and more careful of where I spend my money.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Without hesitation, Kathryn says the best part of a volunteer exchange is the people. “The people we’ve met along the way have been so inspiring. I’m working harder now than I ever did, but it’s worth it. The highs are so much better.” To learn more, you can watch Unearth the World&#8217;s recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvYW8Ef_2YA">Technori pitch</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Steven Dyme and Joseph Dickstein<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: On demand, socially conscious, artisan flower service<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/" target="_blank">https://www.flowersfordreams.<wbr />com/</a>; <a href="https://instagram.com/flowersfordreams/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/flowers4dreams" target="_blank">Twitter</a>; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/flowersfordreams" target="_blank">Facebook</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: February 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_528" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dyme.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dyme-300x300.jpg" alt="Steven Dyme, Flowers for Dreams" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steven Dyme, <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/">Flower for Dreams</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/&quot;">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Steven Dyme is the CEO and Co-founder of Flowers for Dreams. Its aesthetic is quite dreamy, and they actually contribute to dreams by donating a portion of each bouquet’s proceeds to a local charity. Steven&#8217;s favorite flower changes with the season (as do their bouquets). At the time of the interview, it was poppies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On &#8211; why flowers?</strong></span><br />
Steven is very transparent that the reason for getting into flowers has nothing to do with a love or passion for flowers. He’s not an artist turned businessman; he is a businessman turned flower expert.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As college students, he and his buddies had a side business called “Lakeshore Roses” where they would peddle flowers at local commencement ceremonies. “I don’t know if I would even call that a business. It was more a legion of college buddies trying to make a lot of money. We didn’t really know what we were doing, but from all that came this interesting idea.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">They began partnering directly with schools to sell flowers inside commencement ceremonies (instead of just standing outside); and to attract the business of the schools and customers, they donated a backpack of school supplies for each bouquet sold.</p>
<p>From doing that, they realized they’d stumbled across a market that was under served in many areas. They learned that there were no good flower options at low price points. If you wanted to pay less, you got crap; and if you wanted something nice, you had very limited expensive options that rarely delivered outside their neighborhoods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“We just wanted a better way. Maybe we were a little fool hardy thinking that we could provide the better way &#8211; but in reality we could. We were buying our products for commencement events from the same places that local florists were buying their flowers. They don’t have to be so absurdly marked up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On improving industry processes to change the game</strong></span>:<br />
Flowers for Dreams starts all their bouquets at $35/bouquet and offers free delivery within Chicago. How can they accomplish all that? The goal of Flowers for Dreams was always to “provide great flowers at a reasonable price point”. To do so, the team realized they needed to focus on 1) eliminating waste and 2) controlling the process and margins.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Part of our value proposition is that we control the whole process and own the whole margin. We curate the products in house, we design in house and we almost entirely deliver in house. That is very intentional. It’s rare in the floral industry for a florist to control more than 2 parts of that process. Usually, if anything, they only control the acquisition of orders and none of the process.”</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Apparently, in 2011, the Society for American Florists reported that the average spoilage rate for florists was a whopping 37%. “That’s the cost of doing business. 1 out of every 3 stems is dying before sale!” Steven reports that Flowers for Dreams spoilage rate is closer to 4-5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To reduce the average industry waste, Flowers for Dreams does a lot of complicated things, but 2 conceptually simple things. 1) They buy from local markets every day and offer an essentially “just-in-time” service 2) They limit the inventory required by offering fewer options &#8211; a menu of 6-8 bouquets that have specific designs, but not necessarily specific flowers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We don’t have to make the <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/flowers/love" target="_blank">love bouquet</a> with roses. We mimic the design that someone pays for. We use the freshest available and effectively priced flowers in the market that day to sell at that price.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building brand loyalty</strong></span>:<br />
Steven feels that one of the big misses in the floral industry is the lack of branding. “1-800-Flowers is the opposite of brand loyalty. No one wants their bouquet to say ‘1-800-Flowers’. Local high-end florists elicit customer loyalty, but their reach is limited.”<br />
Through growing Flowers for Dreams, Steven has become obsessed with the visual design of their brand, as is evident by their products and marketing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are very careful about the discovery process and the branding. Our burlap sack packaging makes our bouquets easily identifiable out in the wild.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On having a social conscience</span></strong>:<br />
The team recognized that no one was giving for giving in the industry. Integrating social consciousness didn’t really exist in the floral industry when they introduced it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Doing good is really good business. That’s how we first incorporated it. That’s the honest truth. It’s difficult to do something that is purely altruistic and selfless &#8211; but you start to feel really good and it’s become such a huge part of our identity and motivation. It helps me wake up every morning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Each month Flowers for Dream partners with a local charity, and with each new partnership they are making a higher dollar impact than the month before.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On confidence</strong></span>:<br />
As a young entrepreneur, Steven has learned that you shouldn’t be afraid.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid of anyone or anything. Dont’ be intimidated. You can’t enter a conversation thinking that the person opposite you is smarter. You’re losing out of the gate if you come in whimpering. It sounds easy, but it’s actually hard. Your outcome will be more desirable by being humble and by believing in yourself and talking like an equal. Don’t be a wimp.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t be intimidated by what you think is difficult or who you think is too tough or too smart for you. Have confidence in your ability to solve a problem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">Flowers for Dreams is currently working on expansion, a new round of funding and delivering bouquets all over the city. If you’re buying flowers for your mother, Steven recommends their newly released <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/flowers">Spring bouquet</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Deepak Goel<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Karma Circles is an online peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://www.karmacircles.com/">http://www.karmacircles.com/</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: January 2015</p>
<p><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DeepakGoel.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-497 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DeepakGoel-241x300.jpg" alt="Deepak Goel, KarmaCircles" width="241" height="300" /></a></p>

Art by <a href="http://chachi54.deviantart.com/"> Charles McNally</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.karmacircles.com/profile/105/Deepak-Goel">Deepak Goel</a> is the founder of KarmaCircles, an online peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform. He believes in creating bite-sized opportunities for “structured giving” and contributing to the pay-it-forward movement by putting good karma out in the world.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On his product development background and influences</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak is originally from India, but came to Silicon Valley to work for Microsoft after he finished college. There, he “grew up next door” next to all the startup legends under the influence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank">Steve Blank</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries">Eric Ries</a>. He continued to Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley and worked as an early Product Manager at <a href="http://www.coupons.com/">Coupons.com</a> during a period of 6X growth. He returned to India for a while to grow a real estate company, <a href="http://www.indiahomes.com/">IndiaHomes</a> and then returned to the US to be a co-founder at <a href="http://www.packbackbooks.com/">Packback</a>, which brought him here to Chicago.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the idea and inspiration</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak plays the role of mentor, adviser and investor to multiple startups. He advises through organizations such as <a href="http://500.co/">500 Startups</a> and <a href="http://theimpactengine.com/">Impact Engine</a>, and is an angel investor himself; but he spends a great deal of his time mentoring and advising for free. It’s actually all this pro bono advice that gave him the inspiration for KarmaCircles.</p>
<p>“I was giving, giving and giving &#8211; but I wasn’t documenting any of those conversations. I do it because I love doing it, not because I want something in return. But wouldn’t it be great if this could be documented? Giving and receiving is a big part of our life. Why don’t I create a platform where anybody in the world can give and receive for free? It doesn’t matter where you are.”</p>
<p>When someone gives their time within the KarmaCircles community, it is documented by a KarmaNote, which is essentially an online thank you note for what the person did. These notes can then be used to track results of good Karma, create lists of people you’ve helped and taken help from, and build an online profile of yourself through all of the good Karma you are putting back into the world. “It’s like a Twitter of thank you notes.” (<a href="http://www.karmacircles.com/profile/105/Deepak-Goel">You can see Deepak&#8217;s KarmaCircles profile here</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“Uber said every car in this world can be a taxi. I’m saying everyone in this world can be a mentor. We believe that everybody can be an expert to at least a few other people in this world.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On product development and iteration</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak went back to India to put his full-time energy into building and launching the KarmaCircles product in 5 months. He used his experience and education in product management to get things moving. He first shared the concept in a series of 1:1 meetings with about 70 people to refine the idea and concept. Then, he did a mock-up of a visual design and went through another set of 1:1 interviews. After that, he built and launched the product and continues to do 2-4 interviews and interactions daily to spread the word and get feedback and ideas on how the product resonates with people.</p>
<p>True to lean startup methodology, Deepak makes a strong effort to focus on quick iteration and learning versus getting ahead of himself. He believes in evolving slowly, but learning and iterating quickly. Next in line is a formalized marketing campaign outside of word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On investing in startups</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak is an angel investor in a couple of startups himself. He makes it a point to advise the startup founders for several months before making any investment decisions so that he can really understand the strengths of the founders and the business.</p>
<p>“What’s important is that they listen and then they say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They either accept my advice, or they say they’re not accepting it for a reason. If they listen to me all the time then I won’t trust them either.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On Chicago</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak came to Chicago to join the leadership team at Packback before starting KarmaCircles.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I really really love Chicago. What I really loved about Chicago was that people are very friendly. Anyone I asked for a meeting would give me time. People actually told me how grateful they were for my help with Packback. They would say, ‘Thank you so much for helping build up a Chicago company.’ They are patriotic (about Chicago) &#8211; they love each other, they help each other. It’s a friendly environment. I am very optimistic about the Chicago economy growing.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the balance of giving in the world</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak believes that the world can achieve balance through giving and that giving can have viral-level effects if people will just stop burying themselves in their daily lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the things I want to accomplish through KarmaCircles is structured giving. My mom says that everyone in this world should be contributing at least 1% of their time and money for the social good. People have not done that for many centuries. Once everyone starts to devote 1% of their time to the social good, then you don’t need social entrepreneurs to devote 100% of their time to it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>With platforms such as KarmaCircles, Deepak hopes that people can easily give more frequently, in varying amounts and in varying capacities. “Giving will come back to you in ways that you cannot imagine. A company came out of all this giving!”</p>
<hr />
<p>KarmaCicles is also being used by business schools and companies to foster and promote mentoring programs. You can contribute to the KarmaCircles community by signing up at karmacircles.com.  How can you help with 1% of YOUR time?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Rajesh Karmani<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: Zero Percent is a technology platform that connects food retailers with food charities to donate and pick-up food surplus in a simple, reliable and safe way.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="http://zeropercent.us/">http://zeropercent.us/</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeropercentus">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/zeropercentus">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zeropercent.cmi">Facebook</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: November 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_375" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-20-RajKarmani.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-375" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-20-RajKarmani-227x300.jpg" alt="Raj Karmani, Zero Percent" width="227" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Raj Karmani, <a href="http://zeropercent.us/">Zero Percent</a><br />Art by <a href="http://simplyerika.com/Erika ">Erika Swanson</a></p></div>
<p>Raj Karmani came to the United States from Pakistan to study Computer Science.  He intended to, “get an advanced degree in Computer Science, come to the United States and work for the best technology companies out there.” While finishing his PhD, he realized that he could instead use his expertise to make a serious social impact &#8211; reduce food waste with the help of technology and modern logistics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the idea</b></span>:</p>
<p>After a conversation with his local Einstein Bros. Bagels manager about throwing away food, he saw an opportunity for online marketplace technology to close the gap between food retailers and food charities. He began exploring and researching the idea, and was surprised to learn just how big the problem of food waste actually was.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;You can use technology to not just help solve the problem, but to scale the solution. The potential impact you could make kept driving me towards Zero Percent.”</i><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why Zero Percent can kick this problem</b></span>:</p>
<p>“My hypothesis was/is that technology and modern logistics can make it really efficient, reliable and safe to move excess fresh food &#8211; nutritious food, prepared food &#8211; between the source and the charities. Traditional food donation is only shelf stable food. That was the bedrock and ensured people weren’t starving &#8211; but we can go a step farther by using technology and modern logistics.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On going all in</b></span>:</p>
<p>Raj built the technology platform for Zero Percent while continuing with his PhD program. While still in Urbana-Champaign, he received interest and partnered with a national non-profit there. He decided to “go with the flow” and see where the momentum of Zero Percent could go.</p>
<p>The inflection point was when he applied to <a href="http://theimpactengine.com/">Impact Engine </a>in Chicago, the accelerator program focusing on for-profit businesses addressing social challenges. After being granted the interview, the original plan was to have Raj do a video-conference interview. At the last minute, Raj left Urbana-Champaign at 6am in the morning and drove straight to Chicago &#8211; arriving at 9:05am for his 9:00am interview. Even though he ran in a little late, he suspects that “seeing my passion and commitment was one of the reasons we were selected.&#8221;</p>
<p>After being selected to Impact Engine, he knew that “coming to Chicago, working with the best entrepreneurs, getting some funding &#8211; that was the platform I needed to have the best shot at scaling this, at solving the problem.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I had to go all in.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On being a social enterprise</span>:</b></p>
<p>There are some unique considerations and legislative frameworks involved in being a for-profit social enterprise. One of the challenges for both the startups and the investors is quantifying the impact. Raj talks about how investors are used to studying financial statements, but now they are being educated about a new line item on the balance sheet &#8211; the impact. That is why being a part of Impact Engine was so critical for him &#8211;  “They are creating an ecosystem of social entrepreneurship and bringing in investors who are looking to make a social impact”.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On what keeps food retailers from signing-up</span>:</b></p>
<p>It sounds like a win-win for all parties involved &#8211; food retailers donate food and get a tax deduction, food charities receive better food, more people are being fed and Zero Percent can be a sustainable business. So what’s the hold up?</p>
<p>Raj says it is about educating business owners and about making it operationally easier for them to enforce the changes. “They have to communicate to their staff. Throwing it away is the easiest thing, so there is an operational barrier. Every day our team thinks about how we can make it easier than throwing it away for restaurants. There’s no blame game here, it’s just about understanding your user to make it easier for them.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On what individual consumers can do to reduce food waste</span>:</b></p>
<p>“Consumers can do two simple things. 1) Look inside their fridges and think about how they can buy smart, use smart and store smart so they have less food waste in their homes. 2) Consumers can also make an impact at the retail level just by nudging. Inquire at your local restaurant or grocery store about what they do with their food excess. By inquiring, it will put a thought into the mind of the businesses and they care if their customers care.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Zero Percent is currently focusing on reducing food waste in Chicago and then will continue to expand wherever it needs to get closer to zero percent food waste. When you go home today, take a look in your kitchen and think “buy smart, use smart and store smart.”</p>

<p>Jay Savsani  used to build startup MVPs for other people’s dreams. “When people ask me if Meal Sharing is my first startup.. I’m like, ‘It’s my… 40th?’” A few years ago he decided he had found his own dream he was ready to realize &#8211; creating an online platform that brings hosts and guests together over home-cooked meals around the world.</p>
<p>He sat down with me and “just flowed” about how he loves sharing economies, is a little delusional and believes in the power of a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the home cooked meal that changed everything</b></span>:</p>
<p>Jay has told this story many times. He was traveling in Cambodia with his cousin and wanted to eat somewhere where the locals ate, somewhere authentic. He says that it’s the stories where you travel afar, meet someone random and do something underground that give you “street cred.”</p>
<p>“We’d only gone to the Navy Pier equivalents so far and I thought, ‘We did NOT just travel to the other side of the world to do that.&#8217; For years, we used to just turn to the Lonely Planet. Congratulations! You’re eating NEXT to locals, but you’re not eating WITH locals.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Where are they eating? Duh, they’re eating in their homes.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So he goes to the front-desk of the hotel and tells the guy he’s looking for a home cooked meal. “So he brought 15-20 people into the hotel lobby and asked who would have me over for dinner. I felt so flattered &#8211; they were fighting over me. There was a reciprocated curiosity of them wanting to meet me and me wanting to meet them.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On doing what it takes to prove your concept</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>“So I came back to Chicago with an idea and I got obsessed with the sharing economy at large. I read up on ANYTHING about it. I just went wild. This was just 3 years ago. Now Airbnb is ‘cool’ &#8211; but I was hosting on Airbnb when people were like, ‘Why? That’s weird.’ This was prior to Lyft and Uber &#8211; I just wanted to learn everything about the sharing economy.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I would take my car and go to Bears games or Lollapalooza and be like, ‘Hey! I’m cheaper than a cab and it’ll be way more fun! &#8211; Hop in!’”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Jay even ran split tests for himself. He would try to pick people up in his car by himself, and he would try to do it again with his girlfriend in the car and compare the differences in responses. “There was no data yet. If there is no data, you just  create it.” In addition, he turned to Craigslist to see how people would react to home cooked meal invitations via an online platform. “I was just posting on Craigslist, on a non-trusted network!”</p>
<p>To take it a step even further, once things started to really materialize, he told his team of programmers and designers, “48 hours &#8211; pack your bags. We’re getting in my car to go across the United States to meal share, to learn about what this is.” “We went on a month long road trip of basically only eating through meal sharing. From NYC to Boston to Cleveland to Raleigh&#8230; We were proving to ourselves that we had something real that people wanted to do and that WE wanted to do. The group of people we met along the way kind of set the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It was such an awesome slice of America and life &#8211; through food. Everyone had a unique story.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the magic of home cooking</b></span>:</p>
<p>So why is home cooking so much better than just meeting your friends at a restaurant? “I think everyone knows home cooking is better. There’s a certain level of honesty. This is my home &#8211; this is where I eat, sleep and interact with my family and friends. It’s not removed. It’s authentic.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Jay speaks about the ability home cooking has to build a sense of community. He says that he knows people who have found new jobs, significant others and friends through a Meal Sharing experience. He even tells a story of a host whose apartment flooded and his Meal Sharing community came out to help him afterwards.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The power of the meal helps the community.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Jay points out that generally speaking, home cooking is healthier. “We never assault our bodies the way a food establishment does that cooks for volume. I view it as the Etsy of home cooking. It is small batch creation. Home cooking is a liaison to better health.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what ‘they’ don’t tell you and what you should know</b></span>:</p>
<p>“I don’t want to give the standard &#8211; make sure you’re passionate and follow your hearts! Those are the givens. It’s really a balance between being completely delusional and being real about what you want to do.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;If you’re truly creating something from nothing, you have to be a bit delusional.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“When you’re starting a startup everything is stacked against you. All you’re trying to do whenever you’re hacking is reduce that percentage however you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look for something with a polarizing effect. Our goal isn’t to be a watered down version of something where people say, ‘Meal Sharing is okay. It’s alright.&#8217;’’ Some people have told Jay that Meal Sharing is the best thing and they’ve been waiting for it all their lives, and others have told him it is the worst idea ever. He’s okay with that. In fact, he welcomes it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wrapping it up, Jay shares a his hopeful mission for Meal Sharing: &#8220;We want to change how people eat and how people go on vacation forever.”</p>

<strong>Company Description</strong>: Infiniteach is developing autism solutions through technology and training.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://infiniteach.com/">http://infiniteach.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Infiniteach?ref=br_tf">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Infiniteach">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Interview Date</strong>: November 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_282" style="width: 296px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/katie-hench-01.png"><img class=" wp-image-282" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/katie-hench-01-214x300.png" alt="Katie Hench, Infiniteach" width="286" height="401" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Katie Hench, <a href="http://infiniteach.com/">Infiniteach</a><br />Art by Rudy Salinas</p></div>
<p>Katie Hench is one of the 3 co-founders of Infiniteach, a company dedicated to changing the approach in Autism education through tools like SkillChamp, an education software that allows for affordable and customized learning for each student. She is passionate and dedicated to improving the quality and accessibility of Autism education, and Infiniteach is part of that journey.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On finding her mission</b></span>:</p>
<p>“My start in Autism is really from my brother who is on the spectrum. At the time, I did not really understand Autism, but understood how I had to engage with my brother. We have this really unique and amazing relationship which has always brought me back to working with kids and working in education.”</p>
<p>“I’m a huge advocate of accessible affordable resources for every child. The rates of Autism have soared ridiculously in the past few decades. 1 in 68 kids, and a 600% increase in the past two decades! No resources could have kept up with the demand. That’s what my family felt. I’m from a small town in Ohio. We were driving an hour and a half each way to get to therapy appointments and groups for my brother. It was a tremendous strain on my family and that was just time-wise. If you think about financially, when services are in that high of a demand &#8211; of course it’s going to be exorbitant as well.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Families are struggling to afford what we know are really life changing resources. That’s how I got my start, my passion.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On having a technology product, but not having a technical founder</b></span>:</p>
<p>Katie and her co-founder are Autism educators by trade with no technology background.</p>
<p>“We brought technology in the mix because it’s a ubiquitous platform that’s really easy to reach kids regardless of where they live and almost regardless of their socio-economic status at this point. We know that technology is the future of classrooms.”</p>
<p>Katie shares the challenge of bringing the technology development in-house. To find someone with the right skills (not too junior, not too senior), that they can afford and that is in-tune with and passionate about the vision is no small task.</p>
<p>“The Chicago technology community is so supportive. We’ve been very open about reaching out and saying we don’t know how to do this. We’ve had mentor after mentor come in and say, ‘We really want you guys to succeed. What information can we give you to make this possible?’”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On moving from non-profit to for-profit</b></span>:</p>
<p>Katie met Chris soon after he founded the nonprofit <a href="http://www.aactionautism.org/">Aaction Autism</a>, which aims to develop global awareness, support and acceptance of Autism through education and training.</p>
<p>“We could work on it (Aaction Autism) 365 days a year if we had the funding. That’s how we came up with this idea to build a product that&#8217;s effective and efficient and that people will want to buy to help us fund the broader missions of global awareness and resources.”</p>
<p>Their mission is the same, but now their question is “How do we have a socially-minded for profit business that has a mission? We have to go back and do business homework to focus on making a sustainable profit as well as providing a great product. It’s a steep learning curve.”</p>
<p>“It’s very much learning how to run a business so that Infiniteach is appealing to investors and we can find people to believe we can make this happen. We like to talk about the social impact of what we can do. That’s the type of investor we look for &#8211; the type that is focused on social impact. But we want to be a financially responsible business and one that can be sustainable.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On her relationship with her co-founder</b></span>:</p>
<p>“He and I are so opposite. Chris is very much the creative ideas guy and I’m kind of the ‘to-do list how are we breaking it down kind of person. I think that’s really benefited our relationship and we’ve had to navigate how to work that relationship together. It’s given us great division of responsibilities. I really respect Chris and his passion for the Autism community. He’s so talented and that would be so hard to find in another co-founder &#8211; someone who has his innate skills. My goal is to figure out how to open up his mind and put it in technology and disseminate it to the world because everyone deserves to know what he’s thinking.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On most memorable moment so far</span>:</b></p>
<p>“The teacher had been trying to teach her student a skill for months. When she presented it to her through Skill Champ, our first product, the student was able to finally complete that skill. The student wasn’t just able to do the skill on the iPad but also used the printable curriculum to apply the skill in other areas. So now the student is walking around and able to identify colors. This is an older student &#8211; a lot of times you can get so frustrated because they’ve been working on the skill so long. You know they are capable of getting it. We have to change the way we’re teaching it to them. That’s what Skill Champ does. It structures how we teach our kids in a different way that really makes sense for them.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;That is so cool when you hear that your product helped a child gain a skill that they never had before.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why she believes</b></span>:</p>
<p>“It’s the potential. There are a million and a half kids in this country alone that are on the Autism spectrum. It’s also the statistic of when they become adults &#8211; how few of them are employed. My brother lives in a group home and has really limited employment opportunities. I think that could’ve been changed if we had given him more skills at a younger age. I really think his whole life trajectory could be different now.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I’m in Autism for the rest of my life, regardless of what happens with Infiniteach.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

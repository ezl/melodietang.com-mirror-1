<strong>Company Description</strong>: Membership organization that connects and helps business and technology women entrepreneurs<br />

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole Yeary is the founder of Ms. Tech, a membership organization that helps business and technology women entrepreneurs collaborate, network and ultimately invest in each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On learning the ropes</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole spent many successful years working in health insurance business development and sales. In 2008, she decided to pursue her own healthcare startup, and even with her years of industry expertise and knowledge, she found herself faced with a whole new world of challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“The startup world was so different than any business world I’d ever known.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To tackle the learning curve, she ended up taking a job with a newly funded startup as their first official full-time hire. She asked questions; she attended pitch events; she took additional gigs. This all pre-dated the current startup scene in Chicago &#8211;  pre 1871, Starter League, Startup Weekend, and BuiltIn Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On switching pursuits to Ms. Tech</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Following her natural spirit of collaboration, Nicole attended and formed informal communities through brunches (#shygirlbrunch) and created a Facebook group to bring business and technology-focused women together for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“I wanted to make something that we could share and take going to lunch or brunch together to another level. I wanted to see us all get something out of it.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“How can we do business together? How can we transfer the wealth among us, and how can we invest in each other?”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the Facebook group, she realized that “the knowledge share was huge. People fed off of that. They got excited. There were a ton of smart women sharing what they knew and together we created a community that provided networking along with an added layer of well curated mind-sharing. That became an incredible resource, an instant perceived value to our Ms.Tech tribe and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In January 2014, Ms. Tech became an official entity and added a First Class Membership option. Today, they have about 100 members.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On examining the issues</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">“Only 2.7% of venture-backed startups are female founded &#8212; that&#8217;s not the problem. That&#8217;s the issue caused by a deeper rooted problem. To really uncover the root cause of this issue has been a journey. We started by asking questions: How many women need startup capital? How many women are pitching VCs? How much are they asking for? Do they know how to navigate the due diligence process? These are all questions we are working on so that we can develop impact measurement; develop the most viable solution that will create the greatest impact; and truly leverage greater economic empowerment for all women.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole wants to  focus her time on identifying sources of the actual problem. &#8220;Our First Class membership has taken us from a Facebook group to an organization that is serious about working on a solution by taking assumptions and putting them through the same lean methodology to test our hypothesis. That makes us incredibly grateful for every partner and First Class member.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On unifying as a community to succeed</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole believes that at every level, banding together is more powerful than operating apart. “The conversation is split among women as well. Not everyone has the same networks and the same accessibility.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“We are challenged together. We are investing in each other and changing the status quo so anyone can disrupt industries. I would like to see women I know continue to lift each other up, take a vested interest in each other&#8217;s work, and do business with one another.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Even in Chicago there is some traditional segregation between neighborhoods and communities. I continue to work toward a ‘Team Chicago’ mentality, a message of pride in what the people in our city are doing. We should become cognizant of what similar social missions are represented by other organizations, and take inventory of our strengths and opportunities to become cohesive.”</span></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">You can find Nicole at 1871 brainstorming and researching the most effective ways to make impact &#8211; “All of my work is done ‘to impact’ first. My purpose is to make tangible change and create impact. &#8220;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Company Description</strong>: Platform of tools to ‘discover your inner awesome.’</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Site</strong>:</span><a href="http://www.idealemon.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.idealemon.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ideaLemon"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/ideaLemon</span></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Interview Date</strong>: August 2015</span></p>
<div id="attachment_723" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/martin-rajiv.png"><img class="wp-image-723 size-large" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/martin-rajiv-1024x516.png" alt="Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan, Idea Lemon" width="610" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan,<a href="http://www.idealemon.com/"> Idea Lemon</a><br /> Art by Francesco DiBattista</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin and Rajiv are the co-founders of Idea Lemon, a platform of tools to help you ‘discover your inner awesome’. They are optimistic about the lifestyle you are empowered to create by pivoting your inner dialogue, pinpointing your mission and purpose, and turning your ideas into actions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On turning an idea into action</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin and Rajiv were co-founders of the DePaul marketing club in college. After graduation, they both realized how dissatisfying and ineffective the average networking event was and decided to “create our own platform where we can learn what we want to learn and connect with the people we want to connect with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning, they only focused on small ‘knowledge working events’ where they chose a dedicated topic for each event to guide conversation and interactions. They observed how the format successfully guided people to explore themselves and connect with others at a deeper level, which ended up evolving into a study in personal branding. They launched their first personal branding workshop via</span><a href="https://dabble.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dabble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and called it, ‘Discover Your Inner Awesome.’ Since then, they have also launched an Idea Lemon Podcast, been VIPs at <a href="http://techweek.com/">Tech Week</a>, and are launching a new online course soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On personal branding through mission and purpose</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
“It’s really about figuring out the core of what you believe in as a person and using that to structure how you think about yourself, talk about yourself, and the lifestyle you want to live. What is your definition of success? How do you know when you’ve made it? The pursuit of answering those big questions is what leads to the development of everything that we’re doing. We want to help other people answer those questions and use those questions to explore who they are, what their brand is, and figure out what they want to accomplish in their life.” (Martin)</p>
<p>“Everything that you do and care about comes down to two driving forces &#8211; A mission and a purpose. We teach people how to find that, and once you find it you realize that, instead of being a pawn in the chess game, you can become the chess master.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On telling your story</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
Both Martin and Rajiv brand themselves as ‘storytellers’. How does that tie back to helping others find and action what they want?</p>
<p>“Look at everything that people gravitate towards &#8211; it is the story. People want a hero, a villain, and a plot. That’s basically how life is constructed as well. You make yourself out to be the heroes of your own life. There are villains along the way, climaxes, and valleys. We’re telling you to architect your story. You’re playing a character in your own life &#8211; where do you want to take the story?” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“There are two sides of storytelling. There’s the external one you tell other people and there is the internal one you tell yourself. I love the internal story because changing your internal monologue really does change your life. Whatever it is you’re telling yourself that you can’t do &#8211; if you can change that mindset then you can actually change your life and you can bring it to your external voice as well. We try to help people change their inner stories so that when they tell their stories it is actually something they believe, and they are telling an authentic story that connects them to people and opportunities.”(Martin)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the power of projects</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
One of the tools to achieving your ‘inner awesome’ is to execute projects with intention, purpose, and pride.</p>
<p>“You either need to be totally cool with the life you’re living, or you need to start creating something. Side projects aren’t necessarily about financial needs. It’s about all the intangibles that come with it. It’s the benefit of getting up and going out there and doing something.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“It is defeating that you can’t be confident in the things you enjoy. Usually when you’re talking to someone, the thing that they’re doing 20% of the time is the thing they look forward to doing the most &#8211; so why not get the most out of it? Why not use it to fuel and architect the lifestyle you want or the career you want?” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“Once you switch your mindset from, ‘This is something I do on the side that I can’t talk to you about’, to, ‘This is something that I love, and I want you to know about it, and I want to meet other people who love it,’ then everything changes. You’re no longer someone who is embarrassed about the things you enjoy in your life. It’s sad that at some point in your life you’re taught that you’re not really allowed to enjoy that thing because it’s not your full time job.” (Martin)</p>
<p>“Create the opportunity that you want for yourself. Don’t wait for permission, don’t wait for someone else to hand it to you. Side projects allow you to create your own opportunities. That&#8217;s why we’re launching an online course  &#8211;  to help people launch side projects so they can create and capture that opportunity.” (Rajiv)</p>
<hr />
<p>What mission and purpose does the duo seek for themselves through all this?</p>
<p>“My mission is to shape my life to find the most authentic version of myself in my surroundings. My purpose is to take what I learn and tell stories with it. That’s my way of finding that most authentic version.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“My mission and purpose is that I want to understand ideas that are different than my own. The way that I do that is through experimentation and testing. I like to take ideas and turn them into real things for people.” (Martin)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find Martin and Rajiv finishing their epic summer road trip with</span><a href="http://www.under30experiences.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under 30 Experiences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Read and listen to what they’re uncovering and experiencing on their journey via their</span><a href="http://www.idealemon.com/#blog-1-section"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="http://www.idealemon.com/#podcast-section"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<strong><b>Date of Interview</b>: July 2015</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_708" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portrait.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-708" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portrait-300x288.jpg" alt="Julie Schumacher, Well Turned Words" width="300" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Julie Schumacher, <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Julie Schumacher is a writer, teacher, community organizer, mother, wife, traveler. She is the owner of <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a>, her own writing studio, and the co-founder of <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth Chicago</a>, “an organization focused on creating intentional events that celebrate community and connect people.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On going from teacher to writer and business owner:</span></strong><br />
Julie was a teacher for 10 years and fully expected that she would be a teacher for her entire career. She loved teaching; she had tenure; she loved making an impact on her students. “Still, I felt like there were other things that I could do.”</p>
<p>She took an extended maternity leave when she had her daughter and did some work for her husband, an independent web developer. “I was terrible at it.” However, from that, came the idea of Julie using her writing background to help with copy editing for some of her husband’s clients, creative friends, and collaborators. She ended up spending the last few months of her maternity leave creating a portfolio of her writing samples and launched her writing business, <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a>.</p>
<p>“I learned that there are really different types of writing and that you can leverage and differentiate yourself with whatever background you have. I am a good facilitator, researcher and community builder.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s been incredible. I still can’t believe I get to be a writer. It’s a total thrill.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On being creative</span></strong>:<br />
“At Forth, we focus on creative entrepreneurs. Does that only mean people who are doing photography, writing or design? &#8211; No. It is more about a mindset and an approach to your work versus the product. You can have a creative approach to how you model your business.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“People in all walks of life who are thoughtfully engaged in how they do their work and how they’re producing are being creative. There are more jobs now that put the word ‘creative’ in front of it &#8211; which opens people up to putting their own stamp on it, doing it in a different way, or thinking about it across disciplines and pursuits.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On building women-centric community:</span></strong><br />
Julie is and has been active in multiple community organizations, many of which are women-centric. Her primary “side hustle” is <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth Chicago</a>, a women-focused organization started in 2012 by three creative and entrepreneurial women.</p>
<p>There’s a part of Julie that feels hesitant about excluding men. “I think guys are great!” But she knows that “the challenges that women face, the work that we do, the way that we do it, and the relationships that come out of it are unique. Discussing that unique space that we occupy as independent creators and entrepreneurs was something that the three of us felt really hungry for, and we’ve learned from the response to Forth that we weren’t the only women who felt that way.”</p>
<p>“There is a special way that women work and interact with one another. The entrepreneur community allows that to flourish. Forth allows me to write and to engage in creative conversation with people doing all types of things. There’s also hugging at Forth. There’s not a lot of hugging in copy writing.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On side-stepping stereotypes and cliches:</span></strong><br />
“It is so interesting to see the way in which the women of <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth</a> collaborate and share resources. So often the public conversation is about women being horrible to each other. I’m excited that more and more I’m seeing people not just fight against those stereotypes, but just side step them completely. It is like they’re saying, ‘ I’m too busy mapping out my destiny and building other women up to have time to prove that I’m disproving the stereotype.’ I love that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Throw your shoulde</strong><strong>rs back, and step into the person that you are.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Julie tries not to engage or over think the “can women have it all?” conversation, but is also mindful that she has a “great partner who is a feminist, who is thoughtful, who believes in me as a person- I’m privileged to be in that position. There is a group of women who are 5-7 years younger and will soon be moving into the space of creative entrepreneurship and parenthood; and I want to lead by example for them.”</p>
<hr />
<p>You can find <a href="http://wemadethisourselves.com/">Julie and her family</a> taking their summer working sabbatical this year in Christchurch, New Zealand. One of her fondest book experiences is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitterbug_Perfume">Jitterbug Perfume</a> by Tom Robbins, partly due to this resonating quote: “Perhaps the most terrible (or wonderful) thing that can happen to an imaginative youth, aside from the curse (or blessing) of imagination itself, is to be exposed without preparation to the life outside his or her own sphere &#8211; the sudden revelation that there is a there out there.”</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On creating an organic community, Coffee &amp; Conversation</b></span>:<br />
The origins of <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">Coffee &amp; Conversation</a> are pretty simple. Levi sent out a call for other people to join him on Saturday mornings for some productivity. He wasn’t looking to focus the group on entrepreneurship, but there was a natural overlap. What started as a casual Saturday morning meetup has turned into a group of regulars and newcomers sharing ideas and collaborating on projects and businesses.</p>
<p>“If you keep providing the opportunities, then there will be people that show up every time. If there’s alignment of values, common interests, and take aways, then the community will be built around that. When you do that regularly and consistently, people start to show up every time.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t&#8217; have a space, we didn&#8217;t have a name &#8211;  just people showing up.&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>
<p>In the year that Coffee &amp; Conversation (“C&amp;C”) has been around, they’ve already seen the positive output of like-minded people collaborating across unlikely spaces. For example, two C&amp;C members were able to help each other by combining their expertise in immigration services and language study. As a result, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mlangschool">Mobile Language School</a> created a class that combined language learning with cultural food experiences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On community-building in organizations</b></span>:<br />
So how do you take the concepts and results experienced in unstructured organic environments and apply them to structured hierarchies of organizations?</p>
<p>“The importance of building a community in an organization is a big question. It is about applying the values of collaboration and face to face communication. We need to push the boundaries of traditional work spaces where there is usually a competitive work environment of trying to get promotions and recognition that translates into, ‘I need to do better than the person next to me.’ Community building turns that on its head and makes you think about what you can do if resources are unabashedly being shared and if people aren’t afraid of giving up their ideas to the greater good of the group.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Community building creates happy, productive, effective spaces. It improves effectiveness, retention and in turn, the bottom line&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Levi applies his formal and informal education to produce products and frameworks which he uses in client and consulting settings. For example, Insight is a card game that he invented to facilitate team building, interaction and idea sharing. He is currently working on refining an additional product derived from his more recent community-based research with C&amp;C.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“Community and collaboration is a big challenge. But I think it is surmountable by organizations who are interested in doing so.”</b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On effective communication</b></span>:<br />
Effective collaboration and teaming relies heavily on effective communication. “I’m not alone in being sick of emails. They’re so inefficient. It’s about discovering and boosting other methods of communication that are out there and trying to have a more real and genuine interaction. Whatever one you’re using, just make it the best. You can make anything meaningful on any platform.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“Look for a tool that facilitates interaction while letting individuals pick their own level of engagement.”</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>One of his current favorites is <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside of his community projects and consulting development, Levi tries to live each moment with intention. &#8220;I do everything with intention, for both the big and small choices in my life. I put a lot of thought into all of it. It&#8217;s the small things you do and how you act when nobody is looking that defines you.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Co-founder and CEO</strong>: Ted Gonder<br />
<strong>Organization description</strong>: Recognized by President Obama <wbr />as one of the best new ideas for social innovation, Moneythink expands economic opportunity in the United States by equipping low-income youth to navigate the financial decisions of adulthood. By combining high-touch financial <wbr />mentorship with a pop-culture curriculum and mobile technology, Moneythink mentors teach students to save, spend mindfully, and use financial products safely.<br />

<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ted-Gonder-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-751 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ted-Gonder-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Ted Gonder, Moneythink" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ted Gonder, <a href="http://moneythink.org/">Moneythink</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://thedodus.com/"> Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Ted Gonder is a social entrepreneur, a mentor, an optimist for change, and the founder of <a href="http://moneythink.org/">Moneythink</a> &#8211; an organization that is restoring the economic health of the United States through preventative, transformative, and evidence-driven youth financial education. Moneythink is headquartered in Chicago because “if you’re going to solve an education problem anywhere in the US, Chicago is the place to do it.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the power of mentorship</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When I was 14, I had a math tutor who really helped set me straight and aspire to greater heights. From him and other mentors, I learned to think about my life like an entrepreneurial venture and my decisions like each was an investment in my future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a mentor has been a core part of who I am because I think the way to pay it forward is to do for others for what was done for you.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On blending approaches and tactics to bring change</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted believes that Moneythink’s approach is unique because it is taking the best of various methods to build a more complete and impactful financial literacy approach that has never existed before.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Moneythink is tackling the issue of youth financial capability unlike anybody else. Financial education is nearly a billion dollar industry, but the industry as a whole has very little to show for it. What we’ve done is premise our entire approach on high-touch, high-tech, blended-learning interventions. We are taking the age-old proven method of mentorship to transform youth trajectories, and infusing it with cutting edge technology to get better data, to reach students outside of the classroom, and to deepen the relationship between the mentor and pupil. Nobody else is doing that.  Everyone is either doing volunteer programs or relying entirely on technology as a way to reach students. No one else is saying that maybe the right solution is blending the old and the new.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Financial education is nearly a billion dollar industry, but the industry as a whole has very little to show for it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Most people say that education technology helps you reach more kids. We know many of our kids are not self-directed learners yet. Rather than just expecting them to engage with an app, we weave technology into an existing mentor program.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building financial literacy into education curriculum</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted sat on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/26/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans</a> where he had a front row seat into the federal discussion, and an opportunity to represent the needs of younger generations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The unfortunate reality is that financial capability is not viewed as a critical component of a young person’s education in terms of what makes our nation more competitive. This is partially because financial literacy programs to date have been too fragmented in their approach so there is not substantive data that says financial skill-building interventions have hard economic implications on a student’s upward mobility, debt levels, and anything else that a government ultimately cares about. When you try to make the education argument for financial literacy you’re competing with math and science standards, and without adequate proof it&#8217;s hard to justify even slight reductions in time spent on those standards. That’s another reason that we see our role as so completely necessary &#8211; this industry needs some serious upending.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;This industry needs some serious upending.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">On the topic of actually making financial literacy more engaging to youth, Ted says that the program tries to weave otherwise boring financial topics into examples that youth can relate to, such as celebrities. For example, talking about Wesley Snipes evading taxes or the Kardashians&#8217; credit card habits. “It completely changed the student experience. If you meet people where they are and then bring finance into something that relates to what they&#8217;re interested in,  and the way they think and perceive the world; then you can make a big impact into somebody’s thinking.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On winning the White House Champions of Change award and social media</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2012, Moneythink was called by the White House as one of the finalists for the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/champions" target="_blank">White House Champions of Change</a>. “That was the moment where it really become clear that this was a national movement.”</p>
<p>In order to win, the Moneythink team had one week to get the most votes. “If you study people who have successfully built loyal online followings, they say social media is just a tool but what really matters are the relationships you build to help you get your message out. What helped us win the White House competition and rally so many votes wasn&#8217;t that we had a ton of Facebook likes or Twitter followers to begin with, but that we had built a massive allegiance of enthusiastic, college-aged, hyper-connected leaders and we leaned on all of them to drive traffic to this voting page. We’d built a network and kept them updated personally &#8211; not just through social media. That’s what gave us something to tap into that was real. I think it’s easy to mistake social media for something that is inherently substantive, but it’s not. The relationships that you build in real life matter so much more.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it’s easy to mistake social media for something that is inherently substantive, but it’s not. The relationships that you build in real life matter so much more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On measuring change</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our three core metrics are: 1) Are our students saving more regularly? 2) Are our students spending more mindfully? 3) Are our students making wiser safer financial product choices as they enter adulthood?&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are in the midst of a three year longitudinal study funded by <a href="http://www.spentmovie.com/mobilizing-clarksdale.html">American Express</a> in Clarksdale, Mississippi. We are tracking 11th and 12th graders through the program and after the program ends. The first year’s results were just released and are very encouraging. We hope that we can begin creating benchmarks that we can hold the rest of the industry to.”</p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">To condense it all into one Tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/tedgonder" target="_blank">@tedgonder</a> offers, “Dream big. Start small. Save today. Spend mindfully. Watch where you step. Most of all, find a mentor and stick to your guns.” You can read more on Ted’s philosophies on <a href="http://www.tedgonder.com/#blog" target="_blank">his blog</a>.</p>

<b>Date of Interview</b>: May 2015<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_658" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brian-Hill-final-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-658" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brian-Hill-final-1-284x300.jpg" alt="Brian Hill, Jail Education Solutions" width="284" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brian Hill,<a href="http://jaileducationsolutions.com/"> Jail Education Solutions</a><br />Art by <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose</a></p></div>
<p>Brian Hill is the co-founder of Jail Education Solutions, a social enterprise delivering educational content to jail and prisons via their technology platform, Edovo. He believes in bringing together government and private sector solutions to make large-scale social impacts through patience, adaptation and commitment to mission.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the problems</span>:</b><br />
Brian describes a typical jail as a crowded space with people milling around between sleep and daytime television. “Well no wonder this doesn’t work! We’re not getting any results out of this. There are some brilliant people behind bars &#8211; some that shouldn’t be there and some that should &#8211; and many who are there because of a mistake that many of us have also made in our lives. We have to figure out how to use this important time to help people make changes in their lives. We’re really arresting development. They come out worse off than when they went in.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Incarceration is a serious social issue. We have to figure out what we think corrections are supposed to be and then figure out how we can financially put incentives in place to get it where it should be.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“It really comes down to what Americans see as the purpose of corrections. If the purpose is to promote public safety and get dangerous people off the street, then we’ve got way too many people in jail. If the purpose is to be angry and punish people and screw up their lives, then we’re doing really well. We incarcerate in America more than any other country by far. We have gone off the rails. We are spending far too much money and damaging future generations. We got tougher and tougher on crime but we actually got dumber and dumber.&#8221;<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Brian says that in his perfect world of corrections, out of 100 inmates, he would send 30 to proper mental health care facilities that are better equipped to provide specialized care; 50 would just be allowed to go home with limited monitoring and resources; and the other 20 are the ones we should actually be concerned about.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On why jail?</span>:</b><br />
There are many different aspects of the corrections system, but Jail Education Solutions has chosen to primarily focus on the jail population. Brian explains that jail is an interim pre-trial holding facility which means it has the highest volume and turnover. Apparently Cook County cycles through 70K jail inmates every year.</p>
<p>“That’s just a lot of people that you can reach and touch, and hopefully change their trajectory. In jails, your impact is much broader. A prison is only turning over 10% of their population on an annual basis. From a practical perspective, we’d need a lot more content in prison; and from an impact perspective, we can reach a lot more people in jails.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On monitoring impacts</b></span>:<br />
To monitor and measure changes in the population, Jail Education Solutions studies key drivers that decrease recidivism (a person’s relapse into criminal behavior) such as gains to education and literacy. Less obvious, are behavioral changes, such as increase in optimism, which has a high impact on decision making.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Brian says that the “most effective methodology to change inmate outcomes in the long term and decrease recidivism is through cognitive behavioral therapy” so that inmates can practice going through decision-making scenarios.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“In jail you’re not making real life decisions. We can use the platform to gauge how their decision-making changes over time and how it impacts recidivism and job placement when they get out.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Tracking that kind of progress and outcome takes time. So “in the short term we’re really looking at engagement, user experience and education attainment. It’s still early. It’s an exciting time for us.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the power of the individual</span>:</b><br />
Brian says that some of the problems stem from misconceptions within the general population, but also within the corrections system. “There’s this perception that these people will never change and won’t want to do anything differently.That’s absolutely wrong.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Brian describes how when inmates are given access to their content, without any guidance or direction, they usually gravitate towards the most meaningful content. “They’re going towards parenting, cognitive behavioral therapy, GED, and literacy content. That’s been amazing to see. They went for the meat right away. This is them deciding for themselves. If I could hand select it for them, this is where I’d want them to go.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Because the problem is so challenging, we’ve first focused on giving the power to the individual to make a change. Even with all the cards stacked against them, we do believe in the individual and that they want to make changes when given the opportunity.”<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On mission</span>:</b><br />
“Our ultimate goal is to help people. These are our community members living in a different location for a short time. They’re coming home to us in our neighborhoods.”</p>
<blockquote><p> “Our business works in corrections, but it also works post-corrections. Our business does not depend upon people being in jail, and that’s very important. We want to make sure our incentives are never aligned with having more people in jail.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“There were opportunities for us to go after faster money that would&#8217;ve jeopardized our mission, but we didn’t.  We are now highly respected and seen as a leader. People trust us.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Brian understands the reality and the breadth of the problem he’s gotten involved in, but is hopeful about the positive  impacts they’ve already been able to make in the system. “Government moves slowly; jails move slower. But when we turn on a tablet in a facility we make history because we&#8217;ve put more content in the hand of an inmate than has ever been available.&#8221;</p>

<b>Date of interview</b>: November 2014</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_349" style="width: 343px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neal-sales-griffin.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-349" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neal-sales-griffin-300x262.jpg" alt="Neal Sales-Griffin, Starter League" width="333" height="291" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Neal Sales-Griffin, <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">Starter League</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Neal Sales-Griffin is the CEO and co-founder of Starter League, a first-of-kind innovative and immersive programming school in Chicago.  For Neal, the motivation, journey and vision of Starter League is not just about teaching people to code &#8211; it’s about solving meaningful problems, helping people find happiness and making a positive impact. He believes that you can learn how to code (as he did) and that it will enable you to achieve big things.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On developing his point of view and mission statement</span>:</b></p>
<p>Growing up, Neal thought the most important problem to solve was making money. However, while studying at Northwestern, he began to develop a different point of view and mantra for how he wanted to approach life. “It’s not because I’m trying to make money. That’s not what’s driving me anymore. I came to this aha moment. I realized that for me it was about happiness &#8211; I wanted to enjoy my life and I derived the most happiness when helping people. I enjoyed most of what I did when I was doing something that added value to other folks in the world.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong><i>Once i knew that, I just became very committed to figuring that out every step of the way. I refused to settle by doing something that only felt half right or not right.”</i></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Wake up and ask yourself, ‘What are you doing today?’ Are you on a path where you are inspiring others and enabling others to to be more awesome at whatever they’re trying to do? If not, time to move on. If so, keep plugging away.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On &#8211; why software?</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>While in college, he took a job as an analyst for a venture capital firm. He helped assess businesses looking for investors and realized that the majority of the companies were software based. He felt ignorant and frustrated that he was making recommendations about companies that he didn&#8217;t fully understand. “That’s the important part (product development). You can’t just skip that part. That wasn’t good enough for me.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>End to end, I wanted to understand it because I knew that a better product and better value can be brought to people if we understand the end to end process. Once I realized that was the missing piece for me, I decided to drop everything. That’s what led me to software.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On challenges in software development and startups</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>What comes naturally to Neal is identifying problems to solve. “There’s no fear that I’m not going to have something meaningful to work on. Honestly, there’s too much. There’s so much about the world that can be improved and made better.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I’m not going to run out of opportunities to pursue things to make better. I feel like I’ve unlocked some secret that’s hiding in plain sight.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>“The hardest part is actually figuring out how to apply it to something of value. Not just coming up with an idea, but actually producing the solution in a way that accomplishes the goal and produces the outcome the person you’re trying to help ultimately wants. That’s the part I’ve been obsessing over”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong><i>I think too many people are focused on the superficial aspects of being in this space. I think there’s something deeper that’s more important &#8211; are you charged up by what you’re doing, so that no matter the solution, you’ll stay committed to the problem?”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On Mike as his co-founder</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>Throughout past jobs and interactions, Neal confesses that sometimes he “felt like an alien.”</p>
<p>“I’ve developed a set of beliefs about all of this in my life and I found it hard for a lot of people to understand. That’s why I formed a small group of people to interact with &#8211; to challenge me, to challenge them and to confide in with these ideas”.</p>
<p>Among this group of confidants and like-minded individuals is his co-founder, Mike McGee. “We had a number of people involved along the way, but Mike and I ended up emerging from the smoke as partners and co-founders. I’m really lucky to have Mike. He’s one of the few people that I’ve worked with in my life who is not only able to match, but even exceed my energy and work ethic. We also have very similar values &#8211; they’re very much aligned. That value alignment is the most crucial part of having a partner.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why Chicago is special</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>“I love Chicago because the culture is still malleable. Chicago is still trying to figure it out and battling different ideas. I’m very interested in being a part of that &#8211; of contributing and helping figure that out. I’ve always been interested in shaping culture. I think of some of the stuff I’ve shared with you this morning, and those are some of the beliefs I’d like to share with more people. I’d like more businesses to be created with those values mind &#8211; helping people, solving problems, being fulfilled everyday because you’re pursuing your own happiness which is derived from helping others. That’s what I want Chicago to be.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On most memorable moment</span>:</b></p>
<p>“That’s tough because I operate in the now. What’s most exciting to me right now is what I’m about to do in 30 minutes &#8211; work with those students. If I step outside that for a second, I’d say the opportunity that I had to connect with and befriend the wonderful team over at <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. That meant a lot to me. I can’t believe it happened. It is cool that somebody that I idolized has indicated to me that he believes in me &#8211; in what I’m doing, in what we’re doing as a team and why we’re doing it.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why Starter League over other opportunities</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>Neal had the opportunity to go to Uruguay and work for a company while learning how to code and also was given a job offer to work on the Obama campaign. He turned both of these down to create Starter League. “It boiled down to what’s the most meaningful thing we could be doing right now. What are we in the most unique position to contribute? I knew there were people out there who probably felt the way I felt. They were wrestling with ideas in their heads but felt limited because they couldn’t express what they wanted to make and turn it into something real.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Our intention is to give people a set of skills along with identifying the intrinsic motivation that allows them to continue growing and developing outside our walls and to make sure what they’re learning is applied to ideas that make the world move forward in a positive way.”</em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In closing, Neal offers some simple advice on learning and self-improvement &#8211; “I  just do things. I try to do things I don’t know how to do. That’s how you learn. It’s nothing complicated.”</p>

<p>Katie Hench is one of the 3 co-founders of Infiniteach, a company dedicated to changing the approach in Autism education through tools like SkillChamp, an education software that allows for affordable and customized learning for each student. She is passionate and dedicated to improving the quality and accessibility of Autism education, and Infiniteach is part of that journey.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On finding her mission</b></span>:</p>
<p>“My start in Autism is really from my brother who is on the spectrum. At the time, I did not really understand Autism, but understood how I had to engage with my brother. We have this really unique and amazing relationship which has always brought me back to working with kids and working in education.”</p>
<p>“I’m a huge advocate of accessible affordable resources for every child. The rates of Autism have soared ridiculously in the past few decades. 1 in 68 kids, and a 600% increase in the past two decades! No resources could have kept up with the demand. That’s what my family felt. I’m from a small town in Ohio. We were driving an hour and a half each way to get to therapy appointments and groups for my brother. It was a tremendous strain on my family and that was just time-wise. If you think about financially, when services are in that high of a demand &#8211; of course it’s going to be exorbitant as well.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Families are struggling to afford what we know are really life changing resources. That’s how I got my start, my passion.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On having a technology product, but not having a technical founder</b></span>:</p>
<p>Katie and her co-founder are Autism educators by trade with no technology background.</p>
<p>“We brought technology in the mix because it’s a ubiquitous platform that’s really easy to reach kids regardless of where they live and almost regardless of their socio-economic status at this point. We know that technology is the future of classrooms.”</p>
<p>Katie shares the challenge of bringing the technology development in-house. To find someone with the right skills (not too junior, not too senior), that they can afford and that is in-tune with and passionate about the vision is no small task.</p>
<p>“The Chicago technology community is so supportive. We’ve been very open about reaching out and saying we don’t know how to do this. We’ve had mentor after mentor come in and say, ‘We really want you guys to succeed. What information can we give you to make this possible?’”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On moving from non-profit to for-profit</b></span>:</p>
<p>Katie met Chris soon after he founded the nonprofit <a href="http://www.aactionautism.org/">Aaction Autism</a>, which aims to develop global awareness, support and acceptance of Autism through education and training.</p>
<p>“We could work on it (Aaction Autism) 365 days a year if we had the funding. That’s how we came up with this idea to build a product that&#8217;s effective and efficient and that people will want to buy to help us fund the broader missions of global awareness and resources.”</p>
<p>Their mission is the same, but now their question is “How do we have a socially-minded for profit business that has a mission? We have to go back and do business homework to focus on making a sustainable profit as well as providing a great product. It’s a steep learning curve.”</p>
<p>“It’s very much learning how to run a business so that Infiniteach is appealing to investors and we can find people to believe we can make this happen. We like to talk about the social impact of what we can do. That’s the type of investor we look for &#8211; the type that is focused on social impact. But we want to be a financially responsible business and one that can be sustainable.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On her relationship with her co-founder</b></span>:</p>
<p>“He and I are so opposite. Chris is very much the creative ideas guy and I’m kind of the ‘to-do list how are we breaking it down kind of person. I think that’s really benefited our relationship and we’ve had to navigate how to work that relationship together. It’s given us great division of responsibilities. I really respect Chris and his passion for the Autism community. He’s so talented and that would be so hard to find in another co-founder &#8211; someone who has his innate skills. My goal is to figure out how to open up his mind and put it in technology and disseminate it to the world because everyone deserves to know what he’s thinking.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On most memorable moment so far</span>:</b></p>
<p>“The teacher had been trying to teach her student a skill for months. When she presented it to her through Skill Champ, our first product, the student was able to finally complete that skill. The student wasn’t just able to do the skill on the iPad but also used the printable curriculum to apply the skill in other areas. So now the student is walking around and able to identify colors. This is an older student &#8211; a lot of times you can get so frustrated because they’ve been working on the skill so long. You know they are capable of getting it. We have to change the way we’re teaching it to them. That’s what Skill Champ does. It structures how we teach our kids in a different way that really makes sense for them.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;That is so cool when you hear that your product helped a child gain a skill that they never had before.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why she believes</b></span>:</p>
<p>“It’s the potential. There are a million and a half kids in this country alone that are on the Autism spectrum. It’s also the statistic of when they become adults &#8211; how few of them are employed. My brother lives in a group home and has really limited employment opportunities. I think that could’ve been changed if we had given him more skills at a younger age. I really think his whole life trajectory could be different now.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I’m in Autism for the rest of my life, regardless of what happens with Infiniteach.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Katlin Smith is the founder of Simple Mills, a food company that produces all natural, grain-free, gluten-free, refined sugar-free, paleo-friendly, almond flour-based baking mixes. She hails from North Carolina and has transplanted to Chicago to grow her business. She personally testifies to the health transformation that comes from reducing refined sugar and processed foods from your diet, and has created a product that supports her beliefs.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On why gluten-free</span>:</b><br />
Katlin personally chose to become gluten-free because she was experiencing health and joint issues. A friend recommended trying to remove gluten from her diet.</p>
<p>“Three months before I started this business, I wasn’t gluten-free. I was eating whatever I wanted and I wanted to start a pasta shop &#8211; which is kind of the opposite of gluten-free.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think everyone has to be gluten-free necessarily. People find different things that work for their bodies. I <em>do</em> think that people do better when they eat less sugar and less processed foods. Many times, gluten is accompanied by processed foods and refined sugar. It’s better to say you’re going to eat a diet of simple natural ingredients versus to just be gluten-free.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I found such a marked difference on how I felt when I started eating a clean diet.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Katlin says that one of the most intimidating things about trying a gluten-free diet is that people just don’t know what they can eat. Within her first few days of being gluten-free, she found herself in a grocery store looking for something to eat. She wandered around for 45 minutes before she gave up and left with just an avocado. Now, a few years later, she is an expert on how to find and combine the right healthy ingredients to make delicious food.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On health foods in the industry</b></span>:<br />
Katlin cautions that just looking for a gluten-free or healthy sounding label doesn’t always tell the true story. You need to look at the actual ingredients in the food that you’re eating.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think one of the most common misconceptions is that gluten-free and ‘health foods’ are actually healthy. Most gluten-free products tend to be pretty bad for you. Many of the gluten-free flours have a glycemic index that is almost that of table sugar, and it’s just a bunch of empty carbs. You’re not getting any vitamins, minerals or protein. You’re really just eating it to eat. The same is true for other ‘healthy foods’. They are just labeled that way as a marketing ploy.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On getting started as a business</span>:</b><br />
Before Katlin started Simple Mills, she was a consultant at Deloitte and traveling the road 4 days a week. After experiencing her own health transformation, she began to think about how other people could benefit from what she had learned.</p>
<p>“I actually sat on my porch one afternoon and brainstormed all the different ways that I could make the process (of getting healthier foods) easier. It wasn’t just for me &#8211; but I honestly didn’t know where it was going. I’m not sure I believed that it would make it this far at that point.”</p>
<p>She kept her day job, and began working on her ideas at night and recipe testing on the weekends, using her friends and family as her guinea pigs. “I probably went through 90 different iterations before coming up with the product we have today.”</p>
<p>After about six months she had created her first product and after another month she was selling it online. Her first retail store customer was her local Whole Foods. She actually first reached out to Whole Foods for research purposes, but ended up diving into a meeting about placing her product on the shelves. Shortly after she started selling Simple Mills products in Whole Foods, she quit her full-time job and was also accepted into the MBA program at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business where Simple Mills won the <a href="http://research.chicagobooth.edu/nvc/traditional-nvc-winners.aspx#winners!year2014">New Venture Challenge</a> in 2014.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On looking back and looking forward</b></span>:<br />
So how will Simple Mills continue to grow and scale? “Step by step… step by step. One day you need monitors and so you go and buy monitors. One day you realize you need a VP of Sales, and so you go look for one. It’s all about the little individual building blocks and putting them together.”</p>
<p>Katlin highlights the value of finding the right advisors in your personal and professional network. “The most helpful thing is having good advisors &#8211; ones that have been there and done that. At the very beginning, I was lucky enough to have a friend who had just started a food business. Then, I knew a woman who was in 25 Whole Foods stores. Then, I met another Chicago entrepreneur who owned a food business in thousands of stores.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’ve built this business very quickly and a lot of that has been because they’ve given us the help and advice to get us there faster.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On a winning team</span>: </b><br />
Simple Mills has grown to a team of 6 women. What’s the secret to making it click?</p>
<blockquote><p>“Honesty. Our ability to talk to each other in an authentic way. We tell the truth to each other, we talk through issues as they come up and we attack it head on.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>For favorite healthy Chicago eats, Katlin gives a shout out to <a href="http://www.lyfekitchen.com/">Lyfe Kitchen</a>, <a href="http://www.kitchfix.com/">Kitchfix</a> and <a href="http://www.arizekombucha.com/">Arize Kombucha</a>. Looking back to the beginning, what would she tell herself? “Just go and do it. I’m not usually one to regret things. I think we&#8217;ve been extremely fortunate. I wouldn&#8217;t&#8217; change a thing.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founders</b>: Jeremy Balboni, Lance Pinn<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: Hybrid urban rock climbing, fitness and co-working facilities<br />

<b>Date of Interview</b>: December 2014</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jeremy-Balboni-final.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-452" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jeremy-Balboni-final-300x253.jpg" alt="Jeremy Balboni, Brooklyn Boulders Art by John Rose" width="300" height="253" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremy Balboni, <a href="http://brooklynboulders.com/chicago/">Brooklyn Boulders</a><br />
Art by <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose</a></p>
<p>Jeremy Balboni is the CEO and co-founder of Brooklyn Boulders. He and his team have brought “the beauty of new fitness” in their 3rd facility to Chicago with a grand opening party that wrapped in December.  His favorite breakfast is a green smoothie, bowl of berries, one pancake and a side of bacon &#8211; “Because bacon is important.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting the first location open</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Jeremy and his friends actually wrote the original business plan for Brooklyn Boulders in college. “The concept in our minds was actually born 13-14 years ago.”</p>
<p>The plan didn’t take off back then, and the friends graduated from college and took full-time jobs. Jeremy worked in investment finance for a few years before the team decided to revive the plan. “We had a little bit more credibility and know-how … a little bit. We tried harder. It’s different when you’re 19 than when you’re 25. When you’re 25 you still don’t know a lot, but you know more.”</p>
<p>Backed by family, friends and themselves, they opened up their first facility in Brooklyn in 2008, amidst the crashing US economy. “It was successful from the start. And by successful I mean that a lot of people appreciated what we brought to the community. We went into a neighborhood that wasn’t as developed as it is today. I think and hope it (the development) is partly because we’ve established a good presence there.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On leaving a job you like for something bigger</b></span>:<br />
Jeremy continued to work in finance, a job that he enjoyed, until 2011 when he decided it was time to go full-time and expand Brooklyn Boulders.</p>
<p>“Climbing was something I’d been super passionate about for a long time. The fitness model in America isn’t as exciting as it could be. The more traditional models aren’t as interesting as what we’re putting out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Here you have an opportunity to be part of the community in a bigger way. When you have all these people coming to do something they believe in &#8211; it creates community. You’re providing people a way to do fitness that is fun, exciting and addictive in a good way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“You’re changing peoples’ lives in a real way. Now, when you do that in an urban environment you can affect a lot more people &#8211; people that are looking for purpose and to belong to something.”</p>
<p>“So you’re changing lives, you’re changing communities and neighborhoods, you’re working with really interesting people, you’re growing the company so you can offer a way to grow professional careers.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s win-win-win: putting out a positive product, having a lot of fun, following your passion, and it’s good business from an economic sense.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On financing each facility</b></span>:<br />
As you can imagine, building a large rock-climbing and community facility is not a low budget project. After they borrowed money from family and friends for the first opening each additional facility has been backed by a few individual investors.</p>
<p>“It gets easier because you’re proving your concept every time. Boston (2nd location), was tough to fund because some people thought it was just luck in Brooklyn (1st location). We fought pretty hard for people to believe that this was a concept that would work in different places. The risk goes down for them (investors) every time.”</p>
<p>“The #1 reason why investors believe in us is that the team is really strong. Having Brooklyn be successful was a plus, but the biggest thing was knowing that the team can do it again. It gets easier because your network gets bigger, your credibility goes up because you’re succeeding and you keep building the team that is going to make it happen.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Businesses live and die by the people running it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On leveraging his past experiences</b></span>:<br />
Jeremy believes that while it wasn’t the reason he got into finance, it did end up helping him along the way.</p>
<p>“Speaking the investment lingo, knowing what they are looking for, knowing how to communicate to them, knowing how to make them feel safe, understanding how to manage capital and how the world works.” &#8211; to name a few.</p>
<p>“(It) hugely helped me in giving me professional discipline. Knowing how to work with other people &#8211; above and under me, knowing the strength of teams, the rigor of work, the focus required, the maniacal devotion required to grow a business. These are all things I acquired working in the investment world for 6 years.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“You eat what you kill and you are judged by the strength or weaknesses of your decisions.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On mission and core values</b></span><b>:</b><br />
“We have a much better idea of what we’re trying to do now. We always knew, but now we’re able to vocalize it and focus it a lot more than before.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Mission statement:</b> “Facilitate complete engagement of urban communities in unconventional physical spaces by providing diverse unique experiences.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Core values</b>: 1) Get weird 2) Co-create 3) Make it beautiful 4) Be relentless, 5) Attitude is everything 6) Inspire</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what gets him excited</b></span>:<br />
“Good books, good food, new experiences, meeting cool people, meeting cool cities, traveling the world, climbing everywhere.”</p>
<p>“I’m excited about growing the business. I’m doing it with a team that I’m friends with. It’s also extremely exciting to work with people that believe in what we’re doing and are extremely motivated. Everyone works their asses off &#8211; it’s animalistic. But we’re happy doing it. It’s not just working hard to make money, but because we believe in it.”</p>
<hr />
<p>At the time of the interview, Brooklyn Boulders had about 200 employees (full and part-time), and 3 opened locations (Brooklyn, Somerville, Chicago) with construction started on a 4th location in New York City.  Time to “get weird.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Tiffaney Florentine and Kara Albert<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Trodo is a health and wellness company that is creating functional fitness communities through corporate wellness programs, youth programs and league events.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://www.trodo.org/">trodo.org</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trodoboxleague">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/trodoboxleague">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: November 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_332" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tiffaney.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-332" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tiffaney-284x300.jpg" alt="Tiffaney Florentine, Trodo" width="284" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tiffaney Florentine, <a href="https://trodo.org">Trodo</a><br />Art by John Rose of <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose Illustration</a></p></div>
<p>Tiffaney Florentine is a military vet, an American Gladiator contender, a CrossFitter and a certified personal trainer. She has an MBA from The Ohio State University, and has worked for the CIA, Deloitte, Ernst and Young and Gallup. She has mean chops on the athletic field and in the corporate meeting room; and she’s smashing it all together to create and scale functional fitness communities that are accessible, emotionally engaging and life-changing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the evolution of an idea</span>:</strong></p>
<p>While working at Deloitte, Tiffaney tried out and was accepted to be on American Gladiator. “As the show aired, people started coming up to me (asking about fitness). I had 10 times the influence that I had before. TV is a scary thing!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;People started asking me about what to eat and how to workout. I found myself at the center of their life change. This was a turning point. I thought &#8211; how do I drive health and wellness behavior change in a way that is scalable?</em>”</p></blockquote>
<p>With all this in mind, Tiffaney went back to school, got a personal training certification and started working in healthcare consulting at Ernst and Young. She learned that corporate wellness programs were only focused on health risk assessments, biometric screenings and chronic disease management. versus emotionally engaging people to change physical inactivity.</p>
<p>Then, while working at Gallup, she discovered CrossFit. “At Gallup, we quantified human behavior and studied the most emotionally engaged customers. We’d identify the drivers of engagement and replicate them across the customer base. I was fascinated by the intense emotional engagement of CrossFitters and thought, ‘We can study this, learn from it, and change the world by scaling the experience. This is the way to reverse the epidemic of obesity and physical inactivity.’ And that’s the path that led us here.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On starting and expanding</span>:</strong></p>
<p>The first segment of the business she stood up was the Trodo Box League (“box” is lingo for gym) &#8211;  a series of ongoing events for local CrossFit affiliates focusing on community and including events for all fitness levels.  “The league is the foundation that brings our brand to life and has allowed us to develop partnerships and expertise in this space. The end game is reversing the epidemic of physical inactivity and this is the framework to get there. Now we’re working fast and furious to expand into the workplace and youth environment to meet people where they are emotionally and financially.”</p>
<p>Though the Trodo Box League members are all currently Crossfit affiliates and Tiffaney works out at CrossFit gyms herself, she says they are not a CrossFit company or affiliated with CrossFit in any way. “We are our own brand. We pride ourselves on being emotionally accessible to everyone. We study CrossFit because people are emotionally engaged. Members attend an average of 3.75 times per week and they’re seeing incredible results, whereas traditional gyms see fewer than 1 time per week and attendance and results are not key industry metrics.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Getting people to move is all about emotional engagement, not rational incentives. 70% of human decision-making is emotional. We must tend to peoples&#8217; emotional needs to truly change lives.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On mission</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Tiffaney is all about the mission. She believes it is the core of everything that she does and every decision she makes for Trodo. “I had a mentor that told me the most important thing is to have the clearest mission imaginable and everything should revolve around that mission.”</p>
<p>“The team (of Trodo Box League volunteers that help run the events) just oozes the mission. They are so aligned with the mission and they come out to support it. That’s powerful. They are supporting something that’s bigger than me.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;There’s nothing that makes me happier in this world than giving people the opportunity to do something they’re passionate about and to change the lives of others. It’s amazing to see people rally behind a cause that was just an idea a year and half ago.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p>“When we get a meeting with a corporation, the majority of the time companies say they want to decrease healthcare cost and increase productivity. We’re saying we want to make people better.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On having her spouse as her co-founder</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Kara Albert is Tiffaney’s co-founder. She is also her wife and she previously worked at Gallup with her before taking the plunge full-time into Trodo with Tiffaney. “Kara is incredibly talented. I feel that people often start businesses with their partners out of convenience, not because it’s the right talent. Kara is the perfect partner – hands down. She truly has the mind of a strong entrepreneur. She’s incredibly resourceful and can select, inspire and equip the best talent to bring the Trodo mission and strategy to life. Talent-wise we compliment each other really well.</p>
<p>“Of course work/life balance is a struggle and even more challenging because we’re in the same work environment, and then there’s the stress of personal cash flow. Communication gets us through it. We love what we do and we’re truly chasing our dream to change the world…together.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the transition from corporate to startup</strong></span>:</p>
<p>“I’ve never been around any entrepreneurs. I thought about entrepreneurship in grad school but was a too chicken to pursue it at the time. I’ve always supported myself, so I’ve always had a little bit of fear of not having a backup plan. It didn&#8217;t really come to me as a viable option until I was at Gallup. I was in an extremely entrepreneurial role that built my confidence to finally take the plunge. I didn’t know what to expect. I just did it. I knew that I had been through tougher times in life. I trusted that I could be humble enough to ask others for help, to find the right resources and people, and to pull the plug if things weren’t working out.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;If you see a market opportunity and you’re certain you have the resources and experience to bring it to life and change the world, you really have no choice but to give it your all and to see the idea through.”</em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>So what does “Trodo” mean anyways? “Trodo means vulnerability and it&#8217;s all about people putting themselves out there to be vulnerable, to get better as a community.” Trodo Box League currently has 26 participating boxes, 75 volunteers, a reach of ~4400 athletes, and is expanding to build structured, emotionally engaging programs in the workplace and youth environments.</p>

<p><b>Shivani Jain</b> is the Chief Marketing Officer and one of three co-founders of FitnessCubed. While doing her undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago, she met her co-founders Arnav and Ryota. They started working on the concept through the University of Chicago’s College New Venture challenge, and when they won in the summer of 2012, they knew they were onto something.</p>
<p>After graduating, she and her co-founders all took full-time corporate jobs, and worked on FitnessCubed on nights and weekends. In June 2014, they participated in NeoCon, North America’s largest design exposition that takes place at Chicago’s Merchandise Mart. Right after that, they officially launched their Kickstarter campaign with a goal of funding $80K to help ‘“kickstart” Cubii manufacturing. They over-reached their goal hitting almost $300K.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The moment I remember the most was after NPR did an article &#8211; that night we were getting a new backer every millisecond. It went viral! It was really exciting.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Since then the team has been riding the momentum from the feedback and interest they’ve received and is working on investor meetings, product design, manufacturing, and increasing and targeting marketing efforts to get the first production line of Cubii orders out in time for 2015 New Year resolutions.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On choosing KickStarter, crowd-funding and customer interest</span>:</b></p>
<p>“We needed to validate the idea. The hardware space is a lot more risky than software because it requires so much more working capital to get started. We knew we needed to get more feedback and validation. We chose KickStarter specifically because it has so much volume already as a crowd-funding platform.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;More than the funds, we needed to see what peoples&#8217; reactions would be and  if they were willing to pay for it.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The customer interest and numbers help us go to investors and give us confidence that people are interested in buying this. Without marketing, we get at least 2-3 orders/day. It means there is a need. It puts a lot of pressure on us to deliver a spectacular product &#8211; people are trusting us. It’s not an expensive item compared to other products, but it’s not pocket change.”</p>
<p>At the time of the interview, there were 1500 Cubiis on back order.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On manufacturing challenges</span>:</b></p>
<p>The trio of founders were all science and liberal arts majors, with no experience or education in manufacturing products &#8211; so how did they figure out how to actually make a product?</p>
<p>“(Manufacturing experience) was probably the biggest challenge we experienced and still experience. It’s exciting because it forces us to self-learn. In college we were lucky to have had a lot of access to people willing to help us through professors, mentors and the accelerator program.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;You have to be very proactive. You have to seek advice on anything and everything.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On being in Chicago</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>“We plugged into maker communities in Chicago &#8211; people who have launched and made products before and have connections to manufacturers. We continuously seek their advice. When we started, there weren’t many hardware startups in Chicago &#8211; it is increasing now. The communities we became a part of have doubled since we joined.”</p>
<p>“From the Health and Wellness side, it’s the place to be. You have easy access to big hospitals, it’s crowded with health companies and now there are health and wellness accelerators in addition to organizations like Illinois Healthiest Employers and Vitality Institute. We’re fortunate we launched here.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On being an entrepreneur</b></span>:</p>
<p>“ I knew I wanted to have a business of my own &#8211; I just didn’t know I wanted to do it this soon. I envisioned that I would work for a couple of years and start a business later. But the idea got so much traction that we just fell into it. It just kind of happened. I think that sometimes if you try too hard to make it happen it doesn’t. There are a lot of factors &#8211; luck, timing, resources, supportive parents.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On advice for others</span>:</b></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Trust your instinct.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We had so many mentors and we had lots of opinions. One can get lost and lose the vision of what you wanted to do in the first place. Go with your instinct and what you want to do. As a founder, you have the luxury to stick to what you want. You of course should value what people say, but don’t follow everything. You can get delayed if you start questioning everything &#8211; everyone will have an opinion, but not everyone will be right.  It is very basic advice, but it is something we learned and we’ve been learning”</p>
<hr />
<p>We hang around a little longer and talk about her personal fitness preferences. Her and the other founders weren’t using their own Cubii yet since prototype manufacturing was still in progress and the one they had was so expensive that they were afraid to touch it! She most enjoys jogging along the lake and walking over taking public transit, at least until the snow comes. In terms of what else employers and companies can do to support the health and wellness of their employees (besides buy everyone a Cubii) &#8211; she believes that if people would just GET UP and stop sitting by having walking and standing meetings, then we are taking a step in the right direction.</p>

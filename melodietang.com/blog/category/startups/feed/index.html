				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Co-founder and CEO</strong>: Ben Rosenfield<br />
<strong>Company description</strong>: App that makes it easier for freelancers and potential clients to connect. Anyone can make money with their skills on the side.<br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: July 2016</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAALaAAAAJDM4OGM3NmI3LTUyNjktNDIyNy05MjI2LWNmYWM3NzdlNDliYg.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></p>
<p>Ben Rosenfield is an entrepreneur, a traveler, and an accidental reality star. He began his entrepreneurship journey about ten years ago in commercial real estate with <a href="http://www.titancommercial.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.titancommercial.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576333000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiO8bvDbEmfgp41V1omvw-LxAeAg">Titan Commercial</a>, expanded into the technology and marketing sector with <a href="https://freebieapp.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://freebieapp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576333000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGti0mfCNEgX_WR6efBWKWMZszS-g">Freebie</a>, and is now getting ready to launch his latest venture, Hero &#8211; a streamlined marketplace that  connects skilled freelancers, or ‘heros’, with clients.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From estate to technology</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ben has always used his background in psychology and consumer behavior to his advantage. He started his first commercial real estate company when he was 25, and focused on location strategy to expand and attract clients.</p>
<p>“I loved making deals and working in commercial real estate, but I really didn’t think I was doing anything that could change the world and really mean something.”</p>
<p>After about four years in real estate,  he began working with a friend on a technology business and was intrigued by how technology could help businesses directly connect to consumers in a totally different way.  That interest led him to found his first technology company, <a href="https://freebieapp.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://freebieapp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvEa0KgTLcCYkwxR77Pd9GpsQv8g">Freebie</a>, a mobile app that connects social media influencers to brands in exchange for free product. It allows the brand to quantify the ROI on social media investment and effectively build it into their marketing strategies.</p>
<p>With solid technology experience under his belt, Ben was ready for a new idea that was ‘closer to (his) heart’ &#8212; which brought him to Hero.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What’s a Hero?</span>:</strong></p>
<p>“The whole idea behind Hero is that anyone with a skill can make money on the side. We need a faster way to find that instead of spamming our Facebook friends or Googling people we don’t know. Hero is a platform that allows anyone with a skill to make money on the side wherever you are in this world. If you’re a trainer or a masseuse or a social media expert or a camera man &#8212; you have the ability to connect to jobs 24/7. You can market your skills anytime you want. It’s kind of like Airbnb but for your own service.”</p>
<p>Ben points out that there are a wealth of individuals out there with skills that can be exchanged for money, but they don’t know how to make the connections.</p>
<p>“Right now people are driving Uber as a lifestyle. These are college grads and highly trained people. I actually just got off the phone with an Olympic athlete who is driving Uber. On Hero, he could monetize his skill and train people instead of being crouched down in a car.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Hero epitomizes my lifestyle. It allows me and anyone else to monetize their skill sets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Making it easy:</strong></span></p>
<p>Freelancing and side hustles aren’t new, but the ease and reliability of connecting clients and service providers online is evolving.</p>
<p>“What’s holding people back is a technology solution. People don’t want to go on <a href="https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoxbklMJd_A6TZH0_g6ZGQpur6Kw">Elance</a> or <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.thumbtack.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF9OB0cLYO6A5CQ2YMi1DE1Fz0J5Q">Thumbtack</a> because of the amount of paperwork it takes to get onto it. The general population tries to take the simplest route possible. With Hero, the on-boarding and application process takes less than three minutes. Then, you get a follow-up phone call to verify who you are, what you do, and provide some references.”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like the difference between <a href="http://www.eharmony.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.eharmony.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFebEwAKnJtoOnCScjXYQmuHEq0sA">eHarmony</a> and <a href="http://www.match.com/cpx/en-us/match/IndexPage/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.match.com/cpx/en-us/match/IndexPage/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNB0wOKsn_y9WCOee92hsLRaGzAQ">Match.com</a> versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder_(app)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder_(app)&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGw17Yt3t47HpxPU-GiJQdgl65IOA">Tinder</a> and <a href="https://bumble.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://bumble.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBkbPxkhu9Qg_gILa9Yghgvu6yYQ">Bumble</a>. There are a lot of people who are online dating that never went on Match.com because the process of signing up and creating an account was too much.”</p>
<p>In addition to the ease of on-boarding, the cost to market yourself and search for services is free. Hero’s business model is to act as a payment processor between Heroes and clients to simplify and ensure reliable payment. The more you use the Hero payment processor, the more leads and reviews you get to build your Hero network and testimonials.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where to become a hero</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Hero will be launching first in Los Angeles and Chicago.  Los Angeles due to the massive freelancing economy there, and Chicago because that’s where Ben’s roots are.</p>
<p>“LA is the biggest and best freelancing economy in the country. Everybody there is an actor and a graphic designer; a trainer and a waiter. Everyone has a side hustle, with multiple jobs and multiple income streams.”</p>
<p>Ben actually got a first row seat to the LA freelancing community when he had the unique opportunity to be on the Mark Burnet reality show, <a href="http://www.fox.com/coupled" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.fox.com/coupled&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGsQtBwi2B_tsQF05FRPWSct_5xw">Coupled</a>.</p>
<p>“The entertainment industry is built on the back of freelancers. Everyday a producer or production company can lose crew members, and it’s like a forest fire to find a replacement. With Hero, what used to take days can now take moments. We’re able to allow producers to find people and solve this problem more efficiently than before. Additionally, we allow crew members to find jobs more regularly.”</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking back on his experience over the last ten years, what would Ben have done differently? &#8211; “Invest in Google.” Fast forwarding to today, what is he doing better now than in his early entrepreneurial days? &#8211; “Focus.”</p>
<p>Watch for your opportunity to use your skills to become a Hero, and catch Ben on the Fox’s Coupled on Tuesdays at 8 pm Central.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Profile</strong>: Elizabeth Peterson, Eastwood Group<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Payment integration consulting and FinTech software product development<br />
<strong>Website</strong>: <a href="http://www.elizabetheastwood.com/" target="_blank">http://www.elizabetheastwood.<wbr />com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/chitownlizzy" target="_blank">@Chitownlizzy</a><br />
<strong>Date of interview</strong>: October 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_739" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson.png"><img class="wp-image-739 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson-300x293.png" alt="Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group" width="300" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group <br /> Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco Dibattista</a></p></div>
<p>Elizabeth Peterson is an artist, an entrepreneur, a mother, a seeker of truth and continuous improvement. She started her education in arts and fashion, but ended up with a career in financial technology; and is in the process of creating payment software to change the pace of payment on-boarding and integration.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On how she got from art to finance to startups</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth actually went to school for fine arts, came to Chicago to be in fashion design, and quickly discovered that she wasn’t interested in staying in the fashion industry. She changed her trajectory and ended up with a 10 year long career in financial technology services, which developed her expertise in payment integration infrastructure and implementations for large clients.</p>
<p>“I’m a terrible employee though. I like to find loopholes and skip over everything. I never stop at my job title. I always want to boil the ocean and am looking for what’s next all the time. I’m not an office person. I can’t draw in the lines and follow all the rules.”</p>
<p>Though she generally only consulted for larger companies, her client portfolio brought her in contact with a few earlier stage companies that needed her services.</p>
<p>“I was instructed to help out these much larger companies, and had very high revenue targets. But my gut was telling me that it was really these guys (early stage companies) that needed my help. This was the energy that I wanted to be a part of, so I had to put myself there.”</p>
<p>After being introduced to the <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a> community, she had the opportunity to do payment integration consulting for <a href="http://www.rippleshot.com/" target="_blank">Rippleshot</a>, <a href="http://sportslock.com/" target="_blank">Sportslock</a>, and <a href="http://www.getoccasion.com/" target="_blank">Occasion</a>, which gave her confidence to use what she’d learned and validated to begin driving the creation of her own software to better meet clients&#8217; needs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the startup community and scaling</strong></span>:</p>
<p>“I think the startup world in Chicago has a heart of gold. It’s amazing how all of them are connected and partner together on different projects. There’s a different community in startups &#8211; it’s more like family. Everyone wants to help everyone out &#8211; crowd sourcing, camaraderie, transparency.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s specialty is helping startup companies scale their payment technology and infrastructure.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s like watching your kids grow up. You watch these companies go through name changes and team changes &#8211; and now they’re getting millions in funding, and have great success stories. It’s an amazing thing to be a part of, and now it is my turn to be a success story.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On mission, inspiration, and mentorship</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth says that she looks for mentors that share her mission, and confesses that connecting with mentors did not come naturally.</p>
<p>“Mentorship was a hard thing to take on for me. I tend to think that I can do everything on my own and wear a million different hats. But you can’t. I’m learning to delegate to people who are better than me and learn from people 10-15 years ahead of me.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth is inspired by the “radical generosity” among women entrepreneurs started by <a href="https://sheeo.world/#home" target="_blank">SheEO</a> founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsaunders" target="_blank">Vicki Saunders</a> and hopes to “be like these people in 10-15 years to be able to help other women.” Who else is she looking ahead to? &#8211; <a href="http://sunnybates.com/" target="_blank">Sunny Bates</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a> to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On finding new focus</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Last year she founded The Eastwood Group, a FinTech company with the mission of developing new technology to impact the payments industry, and made a last minute decision to go through the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Google_Brand_CHI_9B_General-Assembly&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwkeiwBRCzmo-wiKL49pEBEiQAhvGKYasF8Ep5LDQ22YZWdTFrKRe5em2yhN21C9_boLOX1fkaAhEn8P8HAQ" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> UX Design Immersive Program to regain some focus and structure for her product vision.</p>
<p>“I had to make some things happen. If you don’t have a structured process, then you’re lost. I was lost &#8211; all over the place and was working on too many projects. So I decided I needed to learn how to do it the right way.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i>It definitely took some risk, but you have to just jump. I would’ve never thought I’d be as far as I am today. Now I have so much more focus and I understand what I need to get done. I know the type of person I need to be and I’m excited for the next 10 years.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You can find Elizabeth at <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">, lending her expertise to clients downtown, attending tech events, and speaking on the future of payments.”</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>COO</strong>: Kris Petersen<br />
<strong>Company Description:</strong> Curated clothing service for kids &#8211;  ‘Trunk Club for kids’<br />
<strong>Company Site:</strong> <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">https://www.macandmia.com/</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/macmiastyle" target="_blank">@MacMiaStyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/krispetersen">@KrisPetersen</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview:</strong> September 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_733" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kris-petersen-1.png"><img class="wp-image-733 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kris-petersen-1-300x293.png" alt="Kris Petersen, Mac and Mia" width="300" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kris Petersen, <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/">Mac and Mia</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DeBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Kris Petersen is a serial entrepreneur, founder, and currently the COO of <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a>, a responsibly sourced “<a href="http://trunkclub.com/" target="_blank">Trunk Club</a> for kids.” His favorite place in the world is Door County, Wisconsin and his favorite food is Chicago pizza.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On learning and creativity</strong></span>:<br />
Kris taught himself to code back in middle school, took a class in college, and then really dug into it after hours while he was a consultant for IBM.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For me, learning to code was really an outlet for creativity and building. When I was in corporate America, I always felt something was missing. That’s why I turned to development on nights and weekends &#8211; to fill my creative need to do something. Those activities were never centered around money or building a business.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“People forget they have that ability to learn. In the shuffling of the every day you just think you never have time.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building his way to Mac and Mia</strong></span>:<br />
After many years of working as a corporate technology consultant and launching web applications on the side, Kris joined the world of venture-funding, entrepreneurship and startups. One of his major development projects, <a href="http://www.neighborhuddle.com/" target="_blank">Neighborhuddle</a>, was a content management system for condo boards. It inspired his first official product, <a href="http://www.dealsgoround.com/" target="_blank">DealsGoRound</a> (later rebranded as myCabbage), a second-hand market for daily deal coupons. DealsGoRound caught the attention of the press and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lefkofsky" target="_blank">Eric Lefkofsky</a>, which led Kris to become an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at <a href="http://www.lightbank.com/" target="_blank">Lightbank</a>.</p>
<p>“With coding came the ability to build different things. My entrance into the venture capital world came by way of the guys at Lightbank finding me doing interesting things in the weeds and introducing me to this world.”</p>
<p>After DealsGoRound was acquired, Kris became the CTO of Betterfly, a video-chat learning platform that was sold to <a href="https://takelessons.com/">TakeLessons</a>. He then became the co-founder of <a href="https://www.eatmorsel.com/" target="_blank">Morsel</a>, and is now the COO of <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a> under founder Marie Tillman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On acquisitions and corporate development</strong></span>:<br />
Kris has raised multiple rounds of funding, gone through two acquisitions and has danced with big companies on corporate development. With Mac and Mia, the business currently only has angel investors and is “very calculated on who we talk to and who can add value to the business.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to acquisitions, there&#8217;s a lot of fishing expeditions going on from larger companies. In the end, there may not be a lot of serious interest. When you get that corporate development e-mail from Google, you feel like ‘Holy cow- I’m going to go buy an island!’ The reality is that it is someone’s job all day long to send out emails like that. At the end of the day they may have no interest other than figuring out what’s happening in the space.You have to be careful because it is incredibly time consuming, and it also mentally rattles you a little bit.”<br />
<span class="im"> </span><br />
“Corporate development can be a total distraction from a startup&#8217;s business. You hope to be in the position of power and I think if you are you’ll know. And if you feel like you’re not, then you’re not.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On ideas versus execution:</strong></span><br />
“It takes a lot of motivation for someone to work on something that’s unproven, that’s hard, that might not make money. The alternative is to flip on Tivo and watch the latest episode of something.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s no shortage of people with ideas. 99.9% of them never take the first step.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On executing with purpose</strong></span>:<br />
With Mac and Mia, Kris has evolved his clarity on executing purposefully and believing in values outside of driving a business. His daily purpose at Mac and Mia is straight-forward &#8211; “Getting boxes out the door and increasing the number of orders”. Along with that, Mac and Mia supports a larger purpose of responsible manufacturing and local business support that Kris can get behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m moving forward a lot more purposefully with what I’m working on right now. My personality is that I just get things done &#8211; but the question is, ‘Are you getting the right things done?’ It is about supporting a single measurable goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“In the past, I was just building things because people thought they were good ideas. With Mac and Mia the big picture felt right to me. I want to work on something I believe in. There’s a massive emphasis on women entrepreneurs, sourcing responsibly, sourcing locally, and responsible manufacturing. Every dollar we spend on inventory is deeply researched. “</p>
<hr />
<p>What get Kris excited? &#8211; “Mac and Mia gets me excited. I genuinely believe Mac and Mia will be a massive company.” Learn more about <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/about/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a> and how to add “connection and discovery” to children’s clothing.</p>

<p>Levi Baer is a community builder, a team facilitator, an organizational change strategist, and was previously a nationally ranked <a href="http://www.catan.com/">Settlers of Catan</a> player. He believes in using studied theories and real-life experiences to uncover the powers of effective team building, engagement, and collaboration. He is currently the community manager at <a href="http://workshopchicago.co/">Workshop Chicago</a>; leads the Chicago communities, <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">Coffee &amp; Conversation</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GameNightChicago/"> Game Night Chicago</a>; and runs his own <a href="http://levibaer.com/">consultancy</a>. His favorite superhero is Spiderman, and his current favorite board game is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84876/castles-burgundy">The Castles of Burgundy</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On creating an organic community, Coffee &amp; Conversation</b></span>:<br />
The origins of <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">Coffee &amp; Conversation</a> are pretty simple. Levi sent out a call for other people to join him on Saturday mornings for some productivity. He wasn’t looking to focus the group on entrepreneurship, but there was a natural overlap. What started as a casual Saturday morning meetup has turned into a group of regulars and newcomers sharing ideas and collaborating on projects and businesses.</p>
<p>“If you keep providing the opportunities, then there will be people that show up every time. If there’s alignment of values, common interests, and take aways, then the community will be built around that. When you do that regularly and consistently, people start to show up every time.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t&#8217; have a space, we didn&#8217;t have a name &#8211;  just people showing up.&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>
<p>In the year that Coffee &amp; Conversation (“C&amp;C”) has been around, they’ve already seen the positive output of like-minded people collaborating across unlikely spaces. For example, two C&amp;C members were able to help each other by combining their expertise in immigration services and language study. As a result, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mlangschool">Mobile Language School</a> created a class that combined language learning with cultural food experiences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On community-building in organizations</b></span>:<br />
So how do you take the concepts and results experienced in unstructured organic environments and apply them to structured hierarchies of organizations?</p>
<p>“The importance of building a community in an organization is a big question. It is about applying the values of collaboration and face to face communication. We need to push the boundaries of traditional work spaces where there is usually a competitive work environment of trying to get promotions and recognition that translates into, ‘I need to do better than the person next to me.’ Community building turns that on its head and makes you think about what you can do if resources are unabashedly being shared and if people aren’t afraid of giving up their ideas to the greater good of the group.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Community building creates happy, productive, effective spaces. It improves effectiveness, retention and in turn, the bottom line&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Levi applies his formal and informal education to produce products and frameworks which he uses in client and consulting settings. For example, Insight is a card game that he invented to facilitate team building, interaction and idea sharing. He is currently working on refining an additional product derived from his more recent community-based research with C&amp;C.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“Community and collaboration is a big challenge. But I think it is surmountable by organizations who are interested in doing so.”</b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On effective communication</b></span>:<br />
Effective collaboration and teaming relies heavily on effective communication. “I’m not alone in being sick of emails. They’re so inefficient. It’s about discovering and boosting other methods of communication that are out there and trying to have a more real and genuine interaction. Whatever one you’re using, just make it the best. You can make anything meaningful on any platform.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“Look for a tool that facilitates interaction while letting individuals pick their own level of engagement.”</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>One of his current favorites is <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside of his community projects and consulting development, Levi tries to live each moment with intention. &#8220;I do everything with intention, for both the big and small choices in my life. I put a lot of thought into all of it. It&#8217;s the small things you do and how you act when nobody is looking that defines you.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can find him every other Saturday morning with <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">C&amp;C</a> and every other Wednesday night at<a title="Game Night Chicago" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GameNightChicago/"> Game Night Chicago</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Eliad Inbar, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Interactive software that adds size, look and feel context to online retail shopping<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://tangiblee.com/">tangiblee.com</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/TangibleView">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: December 2014</p>
<p>Eliad Inbar is the co-founder of Tangiblee. He came to Chicago last summer after Tangiblee was accepted to the 2014 class of Tech Stars. Eliad believes he is a lucky guy in life and that people can affect their luck by being open to and seizing opportunities &#8211; such as Tangiblee.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the idea</strong></span>:<br />
The idea was inspired by Eliad&#8217;s experience buying earrings for his wife online. When he actually got them they were way bigger than he expected and he had to return them. The idea kept growing as they continued to encounter more and more stories of people buying a variety of items online that were not the size or fit they expected. “Every time we pitched the idea someone would say, ‘Ya know, that happened to me.’ ”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“There are a lot of ideas that come to you when you’re in startups, but some of them just stick. We knew this was going to be good for consumers &#8211; we just needed to figure out how to sell it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We just couldn’t let this idea go. 10-20 years from now, there’s going to be a better way to visualize products than we have today. This is the evolutionary next step to what we have today &#8211; showing it in context, next to things you already know. It relates to how we already think. You use something you know and compare it. It’s natural.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On getting into Tech Stars and the experience</strong></span>:<br />
Tech Stars wasn’t on Tangiblee’s initial radar, but a friend introduced them to it and they decided to just go for it. They did all their applications and interviews remotely from Israel via Google Hangouts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most of the big things that happen to you in your life &#8211; you don’t plan them. I didn’t think it was going to be this fast. It’s been a life changing event. It was a pretty easy decision to come here. It’s an opportunity we couldn’t have gotten in Israel in every aspect &#8211; business development, investor exposure, trying what we do in a big market.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Coming to Techstars was the best decision we made. It has improved us in every parameter of the business.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On choosing a co-founder</strong></span>:<br />
“We’ve known each other for 6-7 years and worked together in the same room at a previous company. We started throwing around ideas and eventually found one we wanted to go for. We’re very different, but complete in terms of things we bring to the table.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most things you can’t control, but choosing a co-founder is the thing you can control. If you choose right or wrong &#8211; it will have a lot of impact on the business. So luckily, we both chose right.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> On getting the first investors and customers</strong></span>:<br />
For Tangiblee, it has been about getting your network to take a bet and keeping them happy about the bet they are taking.</p>
<p>“We learned that network is super important. The way you present your business is so important. It’s not just about presenting it to the outside, it affects how you think about business internally.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t imagine the fundraising would go as it did. It was very quick thanks to the tons of lessons we learned about presenting our company, showing what’s important and focusing on the right stuff to progress.  When we went to investors at the end of the summer they saw serious progress. They are betting on something that has a good chance.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It (getting customers) was a combination of luck, network and people who just loved our product. Your first customers don’t know if it’s going to work, but they really like what your product is representing. You need someone to take a bet, and after they take the bet you need them to be happy about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On advice</strong></span>:<br />
Eliad is careful and humble to say that he’s not qualified to give advice necessarily, but he is working on and believes in the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Take things in proportion. That’s something I still need to work on. Another thing you learn is just to get used to getting out of your comfort zone on a daily basis, even an hourly basis. If you don’t do that you’re not going to enjoy the ride and you have to enjoy the ride. Most of it is the ride &#8211; I don’t know how the ride will end. You have to enjoy the ride because it is one hell of a ride.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At the time of the interview, Tangiblee had just closed its first round of funding and was buckling down for their first winter in Chicago. “I hadn’t been to Chicago before, but I really like it. It’s exactly what I want. Everyone is trying to scare me about winter, but I’m not worried.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Siva “Shiv” Rajendran<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: Creating portable affordable power from recycled electric car batteries<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="http://totuspower.com/">http://totuspower.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/TotusPower">@TotusPower</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: June 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_678" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shiv-Rajendran.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-678" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shiv-Rajendran-259x300.jpg" alt="Shiv Rajendran, Totus Power" width="259" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shiv Rajendran, <a href="http://totuspower.com/">Totus Power</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.tiffaniemang.squarespace.com/"> Tiffanie Mang</a></p></div>
<p>Shiv Rajendran is a car enthusiast, an engineering enthusiast, and a possibilities enthusiast. After achieving his short-term corporate goals, he realized that none of his passions had any place in his current career trajectory &#8211; so he took off in search of a new one.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On shedding material wealth</b></span>:<br />
In his previous life, Shiv worked at Deloitte. At age 25, he was one of the company’s youngest Senior Consultants in their finance practice. “I wanted to hit six figures before I turned 25. I did that three days after my 25th birthday &#8211; and I really disliked it. I was doing 80 hours of work a week that I didn’t care about.”</p>
<p>During a vacation, he met a guy in the electric car industry, and was really interested in the industry. “I’m a car nut. I’ve raced since I was 15. I was a bus driver when I was getting my master’s degree. I’ve ridden my motorcycle across the US on solo trips.” He decided to sell everything he had except his motorcycle and move to California.</p>
<p>He worked as a director at an electric vehicle start up for a little over a year, but the company closed shop. He knew he didn’t want to go back to a standard full-time job, so he he sold his belongings again and moved into his friend’s garage.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can pretty much survive on $6 a day. It’s not that big of a deal, you just can’t do EVERYTHING. I grew up pretty comfortable, so I just wanted to see what I could do. I have one nice jacket, and just wear it all the time. I didn&#8217;t want to go back to a corporate life unless i was really, really broke &#8211; like less than $100.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the idea for an alternative battery solution</b></span><b>:</b><br />
It was while living in his friend’s garage that he found the time and clarity for Totus Power. A friend of his had moved back to India to start schools that utilized tablets as a way to improve education experiences. The issue was that reliable, safe and affordable power sources were hard to come by in these Indian schools. Shiv began researching solutions for his friend in his spare time and was disappointed with the results.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not a premium market, so not a lot of people care about it. On top of that, it’s not easy. It’s either you use lead acid batteries or Lithium Ion batteries. There’s nothing else. Lead acid batteries are bulky, toxic and have poor shelf life. Lithium Ion batteries are expensive.”</p></blockquote>
<p>From Shiv’s previous experience, he knew that electric car batteries only have about 6-7 years of usage on them before they lose power density and only operate at 70% capacity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For most conventional purposes, the battery is essentially useless and expensive to recycle &#8211; somewhere between 5-10% of the cost of the car. Companies are mandated to recycle the batteries.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“One day, I was listening to music in bed and I literally jumped out of bed and thought, ‘Wait! Why can’t I use these (electric car) batteries?!’” This was in 2013.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On challenges and dedication</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Along his journey, Shiv has been met with both acceptance and rejection. His idea has gained attention and won pitch competitions and he was accepted into the 2014 class of Impact Engine. However, even with all the expressed interest, the struggle to fund a prototype is real. As a solo founder without a US working visa, investor interest has been hard to close.</p>
<p>“We have batteries, engineers, an advisor from Tesla and a customer in Tanzania who wants to launch these batteries across 250 villages where they’re doing massive education projects with tablets. I have all these pieces lined up, but I just need more money.”</p>
<p>Shiv recently returned to Chile, a home to some of his original reception via SeedStars World and Startup Chile, to put all focus into completing his prototype by the end of this year to fill orders.</p>
<p>“I’ve switched back to my 2013 mode and my $6 a day budget and doing paid work on the side. Like I said, I’ll quit when I only have $100 left in my pocket.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Shiv’s dream car is a Pagani Zonda R, but “in this lifetime” he will settle happily for a Subaru BRZ.  He loves the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin">The Adventures of Tin Tin</a>  and is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan’s</a> philosophy of “stepping beyond profits and balance sheets and moving the human race forward” &#8211; maybe by powering education in developing communities.</p>

<strong>Company Description</strong>: Software company that helps organizations connect with civic supporters to raise money, inspire involvement and build community<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://publicgood.com/">https://publicgood.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/publicgood">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: June 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_664" style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jason-kunesh.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-664" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jason-kunesh-263x300.jpg" alt="Jason Kunesh, Public Good" width="263" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jason Kunesh,<a href="https://publicgood.com/"> Public Good</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Jason Kunesh is the co-founder and CEO of Public Good, a software company that helps organizations connect with civic supporters to raise money, inspire involvement and build community. He is passionate about product and technology design, social capital, community, and superheroes &#8211; both the kind that appear in comic books and the unheralded ones that serve our communities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On starting Public Good</b></span>:<br />
Social service has always played a significant role in Jason’s life &#8211; from being adopted as a child, to having a mother who was an active and beloved community volunteer, to joining the Obama re-election campaign’s technology team. The opportunity to work on the Obama campaign came at a time when Jason was examining how he wanted to re-allocate his time and skills to more impactful solutions besides “helping people get to cheaper spa days or flights”.</p>
<p>After the re-election was over, it was time to decide where to go next. The team realized that they wanted to continue what they started and apply their learnings. “It’s really 2.0 for us. We learned a lot of stuff on the campaign about what worked and what didn’t, and how different it was to model community relationships versus business relationships. We’re taking some of the same stuff we learned and applying it in new ways out of the political space and into the non-profit space.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On how technology facilitates social capital</b></span>:<br />
“The big thing is data. That was the biggest thing we tried to solve during the campaign. If we understand that you are the same person that showed up to an event, that engaged with us over Facebook, and came to the phone bank, then we have a much more complete picture of who you are and we can have a better and more respectful conversation with you.”</p>
<p>“There’s all this stuff that you can do (with technology) that is transactional, like donations and fundraising, but there’s additional stuff too. There are all these little things that can be useful &#8211; reading an article, sharing an article, voting, writing a letter &#8211; all these things that you can do. It’s all about how you connect people to realizing that all these little things actually matter, and you can track it.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“When it becomes apparent, it encourages change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Nonprofits are really good at 1:1 interaction, but haven’t been as good at using technology to emulate it. For example, if someone is excited enough to respond, I’m going to respond right away to show that I’m enthusiastic about hearing from them. During the campaign we learned that if someone got back to you in a couple of days, you were 80% more likely to come out and do something. If we waited a week, then you were under 20%. It’s the simple difference of being in the moment and getting excited.”</p>
<p>“The challenge with social impact and social capital work is instead of getting something in return, you are giving something away. To start, if we can at least show enthusiasm that you are part of a community and doing something, then that helps out.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“People who have been doing it a long time will say that they get more out of it than they give away. Once you realize the weird math of volunteerism, then people are hooked and will do stuff.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On design</span>:</b><br />
Jason references the philosophies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams">Dieter Rams</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek">Victor Papanek</a>, and Steve Jobs. He believes that design should provide frictionless solutions, be invisible to the user, and be intentional at every “layer of the onion.”</p>
<p>“I think design is getting into exciting places. In the early 20th century it was products, and then systems that created products, and now it’s about systems. We’re also starting to design behaviors &#8211; which is new. 50 years ago we designed flavors and scents, and now we’re trying to design actual behavior change &#8211; which is exciting.”</p>
<p>“Everybody is a designer and we just don’t realize it. We use tools and the tools are designed to give us super powers. I use this spoon so I can lift up liquid, and this fork to lift up the non-liquid things. These are my solutions. There’s always that idea of context and problem solving, and there’s always more than one tool. But, some are better than others.”</p>
<p>Jason gets a little bit existential as we talk about how design is the space and interaction created between the designer and the user. Then, we think about superheroes and how Batman is invisible, but in a loud way. And he finishes with utilitarian philosophy &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“As a user, you should know nothing of the person that created it. You should know that the object suits your desires and accomplishes your goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what’s exciting:</b></span><br />
“I’m excited that we (designers) have a seat at the table. That wasn’t the case for a long time. When I started 15 years ago, it was about self-definition. You came through the engineering door or the marketing door. There was no design door. Now we have a seat &#8211; so it is about what you do with that power and how do you help early designers figure that power out. You’re not a waiter, you’re a guide.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a fascinating box where you can do whatever you want &#8211; limited only by your skills and your imagination. If you can figure it out, you can do it.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Jason believes Chicago is the place to be for Public Good &#8211; “It’s a civic tech place. It’s a livable international city. It’s pragmatic &#8211; hard working, authentic, roll up our sleeves and get some stuff done. This is where it’s at in terms of nonprofits, foundations and innovation.” <a href="https://twitter.com/publicgood">Follow</a> how <a href="https://publicgood.com/">Public Good</a> is leveraging technology to engage with hundreds of organizations in Chicago and across the US to inspire people to take action.</p>

<p>Hillary Sawchuk is the founder and CEO of A Drink With, an online publication that sits down with the most interesting and influential celebrities, artists, athletes and industry leaders one drink at a time. To date, she’s interviewed over 200 individuals including celebrities such as John Legend, Common, Aaron Paul and Daymond John; and has worked with creative partners like Jim Beam, Acura, and most recently, Virgin Hotels. She is building her internet publication one reader at a time, one interview at a time and one drink at a time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On starting out</strong></span>:<br />
If you check out the site now, you’ll see a sleek, light, modern web page. &#8220;We really want our readers to feel like a fly on the wall, and as part of the conversation. We’re really into the photography and we want it to look artsy and feel like a nice magazine.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“At the beginning, I didn’t know how to buy a domain name; I didn’t know what Tumblr was; I didn’t know what WordPress was. Thank goodness I had a friend, Anthony, who told me I could create a blog for free on WordPress! Then, the spare $250 I had went towards a logo and that just seemed like so much money at the time. Thank goodness for WordPress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the site has gone through two major redesigns and Hillary is already visualizing the site’s next face lift. “It’s always a work in progress.” She reminisces jokingly about how at the beginning, before she learned more about web design, she told her web designer that she wanted to use Beyonce’s website as a model &#8211; turns out Beyonce’s web design budget is pretty big… but it’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On making it a business</strong></span>:<br />
Since the inception, Hillary knew she wanted to turn A Drink With into a business. Originally, they conceptualized a more traditional ad model to make revenue. Luckily, after watching an episode of Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee​, she was inspired when she noticed that Accura was the sponsor of the series episode.“We definitely didn’t even realize that was a thing!” As a result,[because Acura is a sponsor of the Sundance Film Festival] they reached out to Acura and pitched an <a href="http://adrinkwith.com/acura/" target="_blank">interview series</a> featuring the Sundance Film Festival&#8217;s actors, directors and producers in attendance.</p>
<p>With every sponsorship that Hillary lands for A Drink With, she gets to work with the sponsoring brand’s creative team and create custom content for their brand, with no traditional web ads. In 2015, A Drink With will be doing one interview a month at Chicago’s Virgin Hotel which you can see on the A Drink With site or on the <a href="http://virginhotels.com/step-inside/" target="_blank">Virgin Hotel Blog.</a> “It’s really fun to collaborate with brands that align with what we’re doing.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On what it is really about</strong></span>:<br />
Hillary has the opportunity to interview influential celebrities at the international, national, and local level. Her dream is “to have a presence in every city, and to get to know the up and coming talent and people behind your favorite bars and restaurants.” Even with growing access to big-time celebrities, Hillary always wants to make room to feature the people behind local brands in a city.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That’s how we started here in Chicago. There are so many inspiring stories out there that aren’t just from celebrities. Don’t get me wrong &#8211; I still think it’s awesome to talk to celebrities, but no one is off limits. If someone has a great story that someone else can take something from, and learn something from, that encourages them to follow their own dream &#8211; that’s what we’re really all about.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Looking back, Hillary believes that &#8220;everything happens for a reason. I feel like I had to go through some of the lessons I’ve learned along the way so that I can apply them the rest of my life.&#8221; Look for Hillary having drinks with all the cool kids at the Virgin Hotel Chicago.</p>

<b>Company Description</b>: Technology platform that simplifies the sharing, management and reporting of data between startups and investors.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="https://visible.vc/">https://visible.vc/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/VisibleVC">Twitter</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: March 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_606" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mike-Preuss-BB15.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-606" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mike-Preuss-BB15-200x300.jpg" alt="Mike Preuss, Visible" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mike Preuss, <a href="https://visible.vc/">Visible</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.blakebradyartwork.com/">Blake Brady</a></p></div>
<p>Mike Preuss is the CEO and co-founder of Visible, a technology platform that simplifies the sharing, management and reporting of data between startups and investors. He loves data, startups, venture capital, finance and technology &#8211; and has created a product that brings it all together. You can check out more of his thoughts on the investor and founder relationship <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/managing-investor-relationships-and-updates/">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On how he got into startups and Visible</b></span>:<br />
Mike has always been interested in technology and how technology enables businesses to be built on “knowledge instead of physical assets.”</p>
<p>In high school, he got into video-editing and began creating highlight reel videos for his dad&#8217;s cross country team. His skills got him some local attention, and he started doing more videos for other school sports  teams and individuals.</p>
<p>To keep feeding his entrepreneurial spirit, he enrolled in Indiana University’s  Kelley School of Business to study entrepreneurship and applied to the <a href="http://orrfellowship.org/">Orr Fellowship</a> his senior year of college. Through the Orr Fellowship, he landed a position with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formspring">Formspring</a> and followed the company out to San Francisco for a few years. There, he got experience in business development at a fast growing, highly funded startup. He rode that roller coaster until 2012, shortly before the company sold. Around that time, he was approached by investors who shared their idea for Visible. The idea really struck a chord with Mike and two years later he has led Visible from 1 to 7 employees, closed 2 rounds of funding and acquired a few thousand customers on the platform.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On coming back to Chicago</b></span><b>:</b><br />
While Mike’s time in San Francisco gave him critical experience and growth, he wanted to bring Visible back to its mid-western roots.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a huge tech echo chamber in San Francisco that I loved, but it is also great to build a business outside of it.” Mike appreciates and enjoys the variety of experience and ideas that are inspiring the Chicago ecosystem and is excited by the “opportunity that entrepreneurs and technology have to make an impact in the Chicago economy.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the founder and investor relationship</b></span>:<br />
Mike says the most common mistake founders make is that they do not share enough with their investors.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Founders are scared to share bad news. You only want to share amazing news &#8211; but the reality is that startups don’t have amazing news to share that often because it is really hard to build a company. You’re scared to share with your investors, but your investors have seen a lot of companies and can usually help out before things get really bad. It’s really helpful to be transparent with your investors. I know… I’m incredibly biased!”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On being a CEO</b></span><b>:</b><br />
While many experiences of being the CEO and an early startup team member are similar, Mike says the main difference is that the “highs are higher and the lows are lower.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a roller coaster. It’s a lot of fun and amazing one week, but then the next week you think it’s never going to work. Now that I’m a CEO, it just amplifies everything more &#8211; the highs are higher and the lows are lower.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“I’m responsible for building a team and setting the vision for the company. It’s a lot of fun. Everyone is together and you’re building a culture and a company. You can wake up and work on what you want to work on.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On how to get investment</b></span>:<br />
Mike reminds that the most important quality in a founder is being able to execute, not to come up with ideas.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ideas really don’t mean anything -it’s all about the execution.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The idea is guaranteed to change in the first year. No investor is just going to invest in an idea. They’re going to invest in the team and the execution and any traction you have to date. Figure out what is the least you can do to to prove you can execute on something.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what you learn</b></span>:<br />
“If I started the company today, I probably could build in 9 months the business we’ve built in 2 years. There’s just a lot of stuff to learn the first time.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“At first, I was really scared to spend money. But I’ve learned that you shouldn’t be afraid to spend money to grow the business.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“I’ve also learned that hiring is really hard. It’s one of those things that you always read about, but I never had to go through that pain point- and now I get it.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Mike is building Visible to be the “defacto platform of choice to visualize, track and share key metrics and updates with stakeholders.” When he isn’t doing that, you may find him cheering for a Chicago sports team or enjoying <a href="https://lagunitas.com/taproom/chicago/">Lagunitas</a> Brewing Company. And, if he wasn’t only investing in Visible right now, he’d likely look to invest in <a href="https://charlieapp.com/">Charlie App</a>, <a href="https://www.avantcredit.com/">Avant Credit</a> and <a href="https://publicgood.com/">Public Good</a> &#8211; of course he would find out how they’re doing by using Visible.</p>

<b>Date of Interview</b>: March 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_609" style="width: 287px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Katlin-final.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-609" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Katlin-final-277x300.jpg" alt="Katlin Smith, Simple Mills" width="277" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Katlin Smith, <a href="http://www.simplemills.com/">Simple Mills</a><br />Art by <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/"> John Rose</a></p></div>
<p>Katlin Smith is the founder of Simple Mills, a food company that produces all natural, grain-free, gluten-free, refined sugar-free, paleo-friendly, almond flour-based baking mixes. She hails from North Carolina and has transplanted to Chicago to grow her business. She personally testifies to the health transformation that comes from reducing refined sugar and processed foods from your diet, and has created a product that supports her beliefs.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On why gluten-free</span>:</b><br />
Katlin personally chose to become gluten-free because she was experiencing health and joint issues. A friend recommended trying to remove gluten from her diet.</p>
<p>“Three months before I started this business, I wasn’t gluten-free. I was eating whatever I wanted and I wanted to start a pasta shop &#8211; which is kind of the opposite of gluten-free.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think everyone has to be gluten-free necessarily. People find different things that work for their bodies. I <em>do</em> think that people do better when they eat less sugar and less processed foods. Many times, gluten is accompanied by processed foods and refined sugar. It’s better to say you’re going to eat a diet of simple natural ingredients versus to just be gluten-free.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I found such a marked difference on how I felt when I started eating a clean diet.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Katlin says that one of the most intimidating things about trying a gluten-free diet is that people just don’t know what they can eat. Within her first few days of being gluten-free, she found herself in a grocery store looking for something to eat. She wandered around for 45 minutes before she gave up and left with just an avocado. Now, a few years later, she is an expert on how to find and combine the right healthy ingredients to make delicious food.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On health foods in the industry</b></span>:<br />
Katlin cautions that just looking for a gluten-free or healthy sounding label doesn’t always tell the true story. You need to look at the actual ingredients in the food that you’re eating.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think one of the most common misconceptions is that gluten-free and ‘health foods’ are actually healthy. Most gluten-free products tend to be pretty bad for you. Many of the gluten-free flours have a glycemic index that is almost that of table sugar, and it’s just a bunch of empty carbs. You’re not getting any vitamins, minerals or protein. You’re really just eating it to eat. The same is true for other ‘healthy foods’. They are just labeled that way as a marketing ploy.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On getting started as a business</span>:</b><br />
Before Katlin started Simple Mills, she was a consultant at Deloitte and traveling the road 4 days a week. After experiencing her own health transformation, she began to think about how other people could benefit from what she had learned.</p>
<p>“I actually sat on my porch one afternoon and brainstormed all the different ways that I could make the process (of getting healthier foods) easier. It wasn’t just for me &#8211; but I honestly didn’t know where it was going. I’m not sure I believed that it would make it this far at that point.”</p>
<p>She kept her day job, and began working on her ideas at night and recipe testing on the weekends, using her friends and family as her guinea pigs. “I probably went through 90 different iterations before coming up with the product we have today.”</p>
<p>After about six months she had created her first product and after another month she was selling it online. Her first retail store customer was her local Whole Foods. She actually first reached out to Whole Foods for research purposes, but ended up diving into a meeting about placing her product on the shelves. Shortly after she started selling Simple Mills products in Whole Foods, she quit her full-time job and was also accepted into the MBA program at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business where Simple Mills won the <a href="http://research.chicagobooth.edu/nvc/traditional-nvc-winners.aspx#winners!year2014">New Venture Challenge</a> in 2014.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On looking back and looking forward</b></span>:<br />
So how will Simple Mills continue to grow and scale? “Step by step… step by step. One day you need monitors and so you go and buy monitors. One day you realize you need a VP of Sales, and so you go look for one. It’s all about the little individual building blocks and putting them together.”</p>
<p>Katlin highlights the value of finding the right advisors in your personal and professional network. “The most helpful thing is having good advisors &#8211; ones that have been there and done that. At the very beginning, I was lucky enough to have a friend who had just started a food business. Then, I knew a woman who was in 25 Whole Foods stores. Then, I met another Chicago entrepreneur who owned a food business in thousands of stores.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’ve built this business very quickly and a lot of that has been because they’ve given us the help and advice to get us there faster.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On a winning team</span>: </b><br />
Simple Mills has grown to a team of 6 women. What’s the secret to making it click?</p>
<blockquote><p>“Honesty. Our ability to talk to each other in an authentic way. We tell the truth to each other, we talk through issues as they come up and we attack it head on.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>For favorite healthy Chicago eats, Katlin gives a shout out to <a href="http://www.lyfekitchen.com/">Lyfe Kitchen</a>, <a href="http://www.kitchfix.com/">Kitchfix</a> and <a href="http://www.arizekombucha.com/">Arize Kombucha</a>. Looking back to the beginning, what would she tell herself? “Just go and do it. I’m not usually one to regret things. I think we&#8217;ve been extremely fortunate. I wouldn&#8217;t&#8217; change a thing.&#8221;</p>

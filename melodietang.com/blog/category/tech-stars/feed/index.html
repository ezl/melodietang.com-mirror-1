				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Eliad Inbar, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Interactive software that adds size, look and feel context to online retail shopping<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://tangiblee.com/">tangiblee.com</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/TangibleView">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: December 2014</p>
<p>Eliad Inbar is the co-founder of Tangiblee. He came to Chicago last summer after Tangiblee was accepted to the 2014 class of Tech Stars. Eliad believes he is a lucky guy in life and that people can affect their luck by being open to and seizing opportunities &#8211; such as Tangiblee.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the idea</strong></span>:<br />
The idea was inspired by Eliad&#8217;s experience buying earrings for his wife online. When he actually got them they were way bigger than he expected and he had to return them. The idea kept growing as they continued to encounter more and more stories of people buying a variety of items online that were not the size or fit they expected. “Every time we pitched the idea someone would say, ‘Ya know, that happened to me.’ ”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“There are a lot of ideas that come to you when you’re in startups, but some of them just stick. We knew this was going to be good for consumers &#8211; we just needed to figure out how to sell it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We just couldn’t let this idea go. 10-20 years from now, there’s going to be a better way to visualize products than we have today. This is the evolutionary next step to what we have today &#8211; showing it in context, next to things you already know. It relates to how we already think. You use something you know and compare it. It’s natural.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On getting into Tech Stars and the experience</strong></span>:<br />
Tech Stars wasn’t on Tangiblee’s initial radar, but a friend introduced them to it and they decided to just go for it. They did all their applications and interviews remotely from Israel via Google Hangouts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most of the big things that happen to you in your life &#8211; you don’t plan them. I didn’t think it was going to be this fast. It’s been a life changing event. It was a pretty easy decision to come here. It’s an opportunity we couldn’t have gotten in Israel in every aspect &#8211; business development, investor exposure, trying what we do in a big market.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Coming to Techstars was the best decision we made. It has improved us in every parameter of the business.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On choosing a co-founder</strong></span>:<br />
“We’ve known each other for 6-7 years and worked together in the same room at a previous company. We started throwing around ideas and eventually found one we wanted to go for. We’re very different, but complete in terms of things we bring to the table.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most things you can’t control, but choosing a co-founder is the thing you can control. If you choose right or wrong &#8211; it will have a lot of impact on the business. So luckily, we both chose right.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> On getting the first investors and customers</strong></span>:<br />
For Tangiblee, it has been about getting your network to take a bet and keeping them happy about the bet they are taking.</p>
<p>“We learned that network is super important. The way you present your business is so important. It’s not just about presenting it to the outside, it affects how you think about business internally.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t imagine the fundraising would go as it did. It was very quick thanks to the tons of lessons we learned about presenting our company, showing what’s important and focusing on the right stuff to progress.  When we went to investors at the end of the summer they saw serious progress. They are betting on something that has a good chance.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It (getting customers) was a combination of luck, network and people who just loved our product. Your first customers don’t know if it’s going to work, but they really like what your product is representing. You need someone to take a bet, and after they take the bet you need them to be happy about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On advice</strong></span>:<br />
Eliad is careful and humble to say that he’s not qualified to give advice necessarily, but he is working on and believes in the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Take things in proportion. That’s something I still need to work on. Another thing you learn is just to get used to getting out of your comfort zone on a daily basis, even an hourly basis. If you don’t do that you’re not going to enjoy the ride and you have to enjoy the ride. Most of it is the ride &#8211; I don’t know how the ride will end. You have to enjoy the ride because it is one hell of a ride.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At the time of the interview, Tangiblee had just closed its first round of funding and was buckling down for their first winter in Chicago. “I hadn’t been to Chicago before, but I really like it. It’s exactly what I want. Everyone is trying to scare me about winter, but I’m not worried.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founders</b>: Sarah Press and Jason Skicewicz<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: An online dating service that focuses on the offline experience<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="https://www.projectfixup.com">https://www.projectfixup.com</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/projectfixup">Twitter</a>; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ProjectFixup">Facebook</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: January 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_510" style="width: 224px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-17-sarahpress-projectfixup.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-510" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-02-17-sarahpress-projectfixup-214x300.jpg" alt="Sarah Press, Project Fixup" width="214" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sarah Press, <a href="https://www.projectfixup.com/">Project Fixup</a><br />Art by <a href="http://simplyerika.com/">Erika Swanson</a></p></div>
<p>Sarah Press is the Co-founder and CEO of Project Fixup. She has always been passionate about entrepreneurship and bringing people together. She believes in “getting offline as quickly as possible” to help people form meaningful relationships in their busy lives.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting started as an entrepreneur</b></span>:<br />
In college at UNC Chapel Hill, Sarah often fell asleep in her dorm lounge. In the morning, the dorm staff used to come by and wake her up to remind her to get up and go to class. As a result, she formed relationships with the staff and wanted to help them out. She created an online form that connected the staff with university students who were interested in tutoring their kids. The product and concept were simple, but being able to create something that added value to people she cared about was “inspiring and empowering”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the path to Project Fixup</b></span>:<br />
Sarah’s first startup was Communiteach, a peer-to-peer learning platform to help neighbors and friends learn from each other. After a period of time, she realized that though she found the mission rewarding, finding peer-to-peer learning opportunities just wasn’t a big enough pain point in peoples’ lives. She pivoted her thinking and decided to bring people together for a different purpose &#8211; dating.</p>
<p>“Project Fixup had a similar soul to Communiteach because it was still based off recognizing that people are really busy, but really benefit from meeting each other. Instead of doing it for learning, it was doing it for dating. People like to learn from their neighbors, but if you’re single you REALLY want to meet people with similar interests”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On Tech Stars and funding</b></span><b>:</b><br />
In 2013, Project Fixup was selected to be in the inaugural class of <a href="http://www.techstars.com/">Tech Stars</a>. They had bootstrapped the year prior and continue to keep their funding small for the time being. Outside of the ~$100K seed investment that comes with Tech Stars, Project Fixup has only taken investment from one additional angel investor.</p>
<p>“When you’re trying to do too many things at once with a small team &#8211; figure out your product, figure out your marketing, figure out your investment &#8211; you’re not going to be able to do any of them effectively. Initially after Tech Stars we were having several conversations with funders, but it just wasn’t really the right time because we were still trying to figure out our core product pieces. So we decided to take a step back and figure out how we can expand to other cities first.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“You can focus on one of those things, maybe two, but not all three. Feel comfortable saying ‘no’ to some opportunities and ‘no’ to some follow-ups because you just can’t be focusing on too many different avenues.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On finding a technical co-founder</b></span>:<br />
Sarah’s current co-founder and CTO is Jason Skicewicz. They spent 2 months working together on Project Fixup and trying out their relationship before making the decision to be co-founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The world has really evolved in the past few years, so people shouldn’t feel like they can’t accomplish SOMETHING without a CTO. There’s no excuse to at least not start validating your idea and making progress. That gives you flexibility to get to know people better so that you know you’re going to be a dynamic team with a shared vision.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah lists that co-founders should have 1) passion 2) entrepreneurship 3) complimentary skill sets 4) shared vision 5) shared style.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On dating online and offline</b></span><b>:</b><br />
The idea behind Project Fixup is that you spend as little time online as possible. Project Fixup does the work for you and sets you up on an in-person date. Sarah aims to “offer a service where you can still meet people and hit it off without all the other work involved in traditional online dating sites.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“We think the proper mix of online and offline is to get offline as quickly as possible. People aren’t profiles &#8211; they’re very different. A person having a conversation is different than a text you send on <a href="http://www.gotinder.com/">Tinder</a>. People make a lot of assumptions based on these artificial ways of communicating that don&#8217;t really align in person.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah talks about how even offline, assumptions and impressions can be off. “We do a post date review after each date, so sometimes we get to see how people have very different interpretations of how a date went. In one case, the girl really liked the guy, had a really great time and was very excited about him. But then, the guy thought she had no interest in him. Usually we don’t follow-up directly, but sometimes we want to give a little nudge.”</p>
<p>“Dating is hard! Sometimes people don’t realize the signals that they give off.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On evolving as an entrepreneur</b></span><b>:</b><br />
“At the beginning, I thought that as soon as you focus on something and if you believe in it enough it will come true. I was very hopeful and optimistic and I still am. But I’ve learned that entrepreneurship is a process. Even for ideas that don’t hit a home run out of the park &#8211; just the fact that you’re bringing something into existence that can add value to people is really rewarding. Thousands of people signed up to Communiteach and had the opportunity to connect and learn from their neighbors. And even though the full platform doesn&#8217;t’ exist anymore, the <a href="http://learnapaloozachi.com/">Learnapalooza</a> festival came out of Communiteach. It’s an official nonprofit with a team that is still pushing on it. I’ve learned that that has its own types of rewards.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I love launching my own startups, but I’ve also learned that I just love being entrepreneurial in general.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Project Fixup is currently available in Chicago, San Francisco and Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill).</p>

<b>Date of interview</b>: October 2014</p>

<p>Jimmy wasn&#8217;t my first interview, but I wanted to lead with him for a few reasons. Firstly, because it was this coffee date that gave me the idea of the site name. But other than that, he is just so electric and passionate &#8211; it seemed like an obvious opening post.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On figuring out what he wanted to do</b></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I have a different view on life and careers than most people. I think if you’re good at one thing, you can be good at anything. Throughout my life, I have come across things that I was really passionate about and that I really enjoyed. I’m driven by passion. That’s what gets me excited, that’s what gets me up every morning. </i><em>It’s totally random &#8211; it touches my heart and I become passionate about it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(You can read from <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130205/BLOGS11/130209922/how-wedeliver-is-taking-a-page-from-airbnb-and-lyft">Crain’s</a> and <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/25005698-418/jimmy-odom-uses-his-drive-to-deliver.html">Chicago Sun Times</a> that he has a diverse past exploring careers in culinary arts, screenwriting, and even emergency medicine.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On entrepreneurship and ideation</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>I asked him if he always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He looks at me and explains that it wasn’t about wanting it, he has just always been one.</p>
<p>“I’ve always done it. I was that kid on my block who organized all the basketball tournaments. I was always doing it, I just didn’t know there was a term for it. I do wish someone had identified me as I grew up. I’m learning now, but I think it could’ve honed my skills a little more at an early age. I’m so glad that entrepreneurship is actually being encouraged in the school system now. Not everyone is going to be an entrepreneur, but we all have the ability to be one.”</p>
<p>In terms of his ideas &#8211; they “just happen”. He doesn&#8217;t have a special process for it, he doesn&#8217;t sit around and brainstorm and they’re not always triggered by anything.</p>
<p>“They just come. It’s been like this all my life. They just come. I could be sitting at home doing absolutely nothing that has to do with my idea. Just happens.” (Good luck trying to replicate that, people.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On coming up with WeDeliver</b></span>:</p>
<p>While he was working for Apple (a job he says he absolutely loved), he went to Stanford Startup School and came back on an inspirational high.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I came back and I was just on fire for entrepreneurship, and on fire for technology. Being surrounded by some of the smartest people in the world… that was electrifying and invigorating.&#8221; </i></p></blockquote>
<p>He knew he wanted to build something, but it was just a matter of what. He thought of it after his mother asked him to pick up a prescription for her.</p>
<p>“The pharmacy was right next to the pizza delivery place. It just didn&#8217;t make sense. Why doesn&#8217;t it (on demand delivery) exist? Let’s build it. Simply put- it was just the right place at the right time and I knew I wanted to do this.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On building a team</b></span>:</p>
<p>Jimmy doesn&#8217;t consider building a team to be a traditional hiring process.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If you look at the creation of the planets &#8211; there are just interactions, collisions and chaos. And from chaos, comes order.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<div id="attachment_56" style="width: 417px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image.png"><img class="wp-image-56" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image.png" alt="Illustration by Alexa Tang" width="407" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by Alexa Tang</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Developing a team in the early stages &#8211; those were just collisions &#8211; meeting people in the environment and seeing who you stick with through gravitational pulls. That’s how we all met. It wasn&#8217;t probably until employee 15 that I started to think more strategically about who comes into the company and what role they will fill. That is something I had to change in terms of how I look at growing the company.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting customers</b></span>:</p>
<p>“I literally went from door to door down Chicago avenue.”</p>
<p>Now that he has customers, his approach is still the same except that WeDeliver is getting a good amount of referral business as well. “If you want to build a business that empowers local businesses you need to get out, you need to talk to them, you need to see them, you need to meet them. I like to have a relationship with you.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On handling rejection</span>:</b><br />
<i></i></p>
<p>“Each time it was good to reinforce that I’m not doing this to get into an event, I’m not doing this to get into a competition, I’m doing this because I see this business growing and I like my customers. I love what we do. Those other things are ancillary, they’re extra. It’s not the substance of the cake &#8211; it’s just frosting. It was so important for us to get back into the right mind set. It is all a mindset and how you think.”</p>
<p>(WeDeliver did NOT get into Tech Week or Tech Starters the first time around.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On advice ‘they’ don’t tell you</b></span>:</p>
<p>Apparently it is all about trusting yourself and learning from the right sci-fi hero.</p>
<p>“It’s so important for entrepreneurs to truly trust their instincts &#8211; to believe in themselves. We look at those that have built companies and think that whatever they know is better than what I know, whatever they&#8217;ve done is better than what I&#8217;ve done. I&#8217;ve met a ton of mentors over the last 2 years and each potential mentor comes and assesses a problem as if they have first hand knowledge of everything. You see something others don’t see &#8211; that’s why you’re the innovator. You see further down the road and you see what others don’t see &#8211; or else they would have built it. Trust the vision. Others can help shape it, but you have to trust your vision. <b> </b>If you can align mission, vision and purpose with metrics &#8211; then some really interesting things happen.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I find inspiration everywhere.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Do you watch the show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)">Heroes</a>? Two of the most powerful characters of the show are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylar">Sylar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Petrelli">Peter</a>. Sylar has to be hands on and dirty to accumulate abilities and become the all powerful villain. Peter just has to be next to you &#8211; just in your presence and he can get your ability. That’s what I want to be like. As an entrepreneur, I want to surround myself with amazing people so that the more I’m around them &#8211; I can see their skill set, see what makes them special, learn from them, and make them part of my team.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;‘Become like Peter Petrelli.’ &#8211; We’ll make bumper stickers of that.”</em></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<p>Jimmy starts telling me a story after I&#8217;ve stopped recording and while he’s grabbing for his iPhone. He tells me that yesterday he left his iPhone on the train. After realizing he left it, he begins to track it via the GPS in his phone. He continues to drive next to the train that has his phone and realizes that his phone got off the train and has gone to an actual physical address. Against his wife’s advice, he decides he will see this to the end. He walks up to the door, rings the doorbell, asks for his phone back, gets it back and goes on with his day. I think this story represents his general spirit &#8211; he <b>sees</b> it, he <b>cares</b> about it, he goes to <b>get it</b>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole Yeary is the founder of Ms. Tech, a membership organization that helps business and technology women entrepreneurs collaborate, network and ultimately invest in each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On learning the ropes</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole spent many successful years working in health insurance business development and sales. In 2008, she decided to pursue her own healthcare startup, and even with her years of industry expertise and knowledge, she found herself faced with a whole new world of challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“The startup world was so different than any business world I’d ever known.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To tackle the learning curve, she ended up taking a job with a newly funded startup as their first official full-time hire. She asked questions; she attended pitch events; she took additional gigs. This all pre-dated the current startup scene in Chicago &#8211;  pre 1871, Starter League, Startup Weekend, and BuiltIn Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On switching pursuits to Ms. Tech</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Following her natural spirit of collaboration, Nicole attended and formed informal communities through brunches (#shygirlbrunch) and created a Facebook group to bring business and technology-focused women together for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“I wanted to make something that we could share and take going to lunch or brunch together to another level. I wanted to see us all get something out of it.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“How can we do business together? How can we transfer the wealth among us, and how can we invest in each other?”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the Facebook group, she realized that “the knowledge share was huge. People fed off of that. They got excited. There were a ton of smart women sharing what they knew and together we created a community that provided networking along with an added layer of well curated mind-sharing. That became an incredible resource, an instant perceived value to our Ms.Tech tribe and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In January 2014, Ms. Tech became an official entity and added a First Class Membership option. Today, they have about 100 members.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On examining the issues</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">“Only 2.7% of venture-backed startups are female founded &#8212; that&#8217;s not the problem. That&#8217;s the issue caused by a deeper rooted problem. To really uncover the root cause of this issue has been a journey. We started by asking questions: How many women need startup capital? How many women are pitching VCs? How much are they asking for? Do they know how to navigate the due diligence process? These are all questions we are working on so that we can develop impact measurement; develop the most viable solution that will create the greatest impact; and truly leverage greater economic empowerment for all women.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole wants to  focus her time on identifying sources of the actual problem. &#8220;Our First Class membership has taken us from a Facebook group to an organization that is serious about working on a solution by taking assumptions and putting them through the same lean methodology to test our hypothesis. That makes us incredibly grateful for every partner and First Class member.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On unifying as a community to succeed</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole believes that at every level, banding together is more powerful than operating apart. “The conversation is split among women as well. Not everyone has the same networks and the same accessibility.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“We are challenged together. We are investing in each other and changing the status quo so anyone can disrupt industries. I would like to see women I know continue to lift each other up, take a vested interest in each other&#8217;s work, and do business with one another.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Even in Chicago there is some traditional segregation between neighborhoods and communities. I continue to work toward a ‘Team Chicago’ mentality, a message of pride in what the people in our city are doing. We should become cognizant of what similar social missions are represented by other organizations, and take inventory of our strengths and opportunities to become cohesive.”</span></p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">You can find Nicole at 1871 brainstorming and researching the most effective ways to make impact &#8211; “All of my work is done ‘to impact’ first. My purpose is to make tangible change and create impact. &#8220;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Profile</strong>: Elizabeth Peterson, Eastwood Group<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Payment integration consulting and FinTech software product development<br />
<strong>Website</strong>: <a href="http://www.elizabetheastwood.com/" target="_blank">http://www.elizabetheastwood.<wbr />com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/chitownlizzy" target="_blank">@Chitownlizzy</a><br />
<strong>Date of interview</strong>: October 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_739" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson.png"><img class="wp-image-739 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson-300x293.png" alt="Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group" width="300" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group <br /> Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco Dibattista</a></p></div>
<p>Elizabeth Peterson is an artist, an entrepreneur, a mother, a seeker of truth and continuous improvement. She started her education in arts and fashion, but ended up with a career in financial technology; and is in the process of creating payment software to change the pace of payment on-boarding and integration.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On how she got from art to finance to startups</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth actually went to school for fine arts, came to Chicago to be in fashion design, and quickly discovered that she wasn’t interested in staying in the fashion industry. She changed her trajectory and ended up with a 10 year long career in financial technology services, which developed her expertise in payment integration infrastructure and implementations for large clients.</p>
<p>“I’m a terrible employee though. I like to find loopholes and skip over everything. I never stop at my job title. I always want to boil the ocean and am looking for what’s next all the time. I’m not an office person. I can’t draw in the lines and follow all the rules.”</p>
<p>Though she generally only consulted for larger companies, her client portfolio brought her in contact with a few earlier stage companies that needed her services.</p>
<p>“I was instructed to help out these much larger companies, and had very high revenue targets. But my gut was telling me that it was really these guys (early stage companies) that needed my help. This was the energy that I wanted to be a part of, so I had to put myself there.”</p>
<p>After being introduced to the <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a> community, she had the opportunity to do payment integration consulting for <a href="http://www.rippleshot.com/" target="_blank">Rippleshot</a>, <a href="http://sportslock.com/" target="_blank">Sportslock</a>, and <a href="http://www.getoccasion.com/" target="_blank">Occasion</a>, which gave her confidence to use what she’d learned and validated to begin driving the creation of her own software to better meet clients&#8217; needs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the startup community and scaling</strong></span>:</p>
<p>“I think the startup world in Chicago has a heart of gold. It’s amazing how all of them are connected and partner together on different projects. There’s a different community in startups &#8211; it’s more like family. Everyone wants to help everyone out &#8211; crowd sourcing, camaraderie, transparency.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s specialty is helping startup companies scale their payment technology and infrastructure.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s like watching your kids grow up. You watch these companies go through name changes and team changes &#8211; and now they’re getting millions in funding, and have great success stories. It’s an amazing thing to be a part of, and now it is my turn to be a success story.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On mission, inspiration, and mentorship</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth says that she looks for mentors that share her mission, and confesses that connecting with mentors did not come naturally.</p>
<p>“Mentorship was a hard thing to take on for me. I tend to think that I can do everything on my own and wear a million different hats. But you can’t. I’m learning to delegate to people who are better than me and learn from people 10-15 years ahead of me.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth is inspired by the “radical generosity” among women entrepreneurs started by <a href="https://sheeo.world/#home" target="_blank">SheEO</a> founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsaunders" target="_blank">Vicki Saunders</a> and hopes to “be like these people in 10-15 years to be able to help other women.” Who else is she looking ahead to? &#8211; <a href="http://sunnybates.com/" target="_blank">Sunny Bates</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a> to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On finding new focus</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Last year she founded The Eastwood Group, a FinTech company with the mission of developing new technology to impact the payments industry, and made a last minute decision to go through the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Google_Brand_CHI_9B_General-Assembly&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwkeiwBRCzmo-wiKL49pEBEiQAhvGKYasF8Ep5LDQ22YZWdTFrKRe5em2yhN21C9_boLOX1fkaAhEn8P8HAQ" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> UX Design Immersive Program to regain some focus and structure for her product vision.</p>
<p>“I had to make some things happen. If you don’t have a structured process, then you’re lost. I was lost &#8211; all over the place and was working on too many projects. So I decided I needed to learn how to do it the right way.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i>It definitely took some risk, but you have to just jump. I would’ve never thought I’d be as far as I am today. Now I have so much more focus and I understand what I need to get done. I know the type of person I need to be and I’m excited for the next 10 years.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You can find Elizabeth at <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">, lending her expertise to clients downtown, attending tech events, and speaking on the future of payments.”</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Siva “Shiv” Rajendran<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: Creating portable affordable power from recycled electric car batteries<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="http://totuspower.com/">http://totuspower.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/TotusPower">@TotusPower</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: June 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_678" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shiv-Rajendran.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-678" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shiv-Rajendran-259x300.jpg" alt="Shiv Rajendran, Totus Power" width="259" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shiv Rajendran, <a href="http://totuspower.com/">Totus Power</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.tiffaniemang.squarespace.com/"> Tiffanie Mang</a></p></div>
<p>Shiv Rajendran is a car enthusiast, an engineering enthusiast, and a possibilities enthusiast. After achieving his short-term corporate goals, he realized that none of his passions had any place in his current career trajectory &#8211; so he took off in search of a new one.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On shedding material wealth</b></span>:<br />
In his previous life, Shiv worked at Deloitte. At age 25, he was one of the company’s youngest Senior Consultants in their finance practice. “I wanted to hit six figures before I turned 25. I did that three days after my 25th birthday &#8211; and I really disliked it. I was doing 80 hours of work a week that I didn’t care about.”</p>
<p>During a vacation, he met a guy in the electric car industry, and was really interested in the industry. “I’m a car nut. I’ve raced since I was 15. I was a bus driver when I was getting my master’s degree. I’ve ridden my motorcycle across the US on solo trips.” He decided to sell everything he had except his motorcycle and move to California.</p>
<p>He worked as a director at an electric vehicle start up for a little over a year, but the company closed shop. He knew he didn’t want to go back to a standard full-time job, so he he sold his belongings again and moved into his friend’s garage.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can pretty much survive on $6 a day. It’s not that big of a deal, you just can’t do EVERYTHING. I grew up pretty comfortable, so I just wanted to see what I could do. I have one nice jacket, and just wear it all the time. I didn&#8217;t want to go back to a corporate life unless i was really, really broke &#8211; like less than $100.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the idea for an alternative battery solution</b></span><b>:</b><br />
It was while living in his friend’s garage that he found the time and clarity for Totus Power. A friend of his had moved back to India to start schools that utilized tablets as a way to improve education experiences. The issue was that reliable, safe and affordable power sources were hard to come by in these Indian schools. Shiv began researching solutions for his friend in his spare time and was disappointed with the results.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not a premium market, so not a lot of people care about it. On top of that, it’s not easy. It’s either you use lead acid batteries or Lithium Ion batteries. There’s nothing else. Lead acid batteries are bulky, toxic and have poor shelf life. Lithium Ion batteries are expensive.”</p></blockquote>
<p>From Shiv’s previous experience, he knew that electric car batteries only have about 6-7 years of usage on them before they lose power density and only operate at 70% capacity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For most conventional purposes, the battery is essentially useless and expensive to recycle &#8211; somewhere between 5-10% of the cost of the car. Companies are mandated to recycle the batteries.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“One day, I was listening to music in bed and I literally jumped out of bed and thought, ‘Wait! Why can’t I use these (electric car) batteries?!’” This was in 2013.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On challenges and dedication</b></span><b>:</b><br />
Along his journey, Shiv has been met with both acceptance and rejection. His idea has gained attention and won pitch competitions and he was accepted into the 2014 class of Impact Engine. However, even with all the expressed interest, the struggle to fund a prototype is real. As a solo founder without a US working visa, investor interest has been hard to close.</p>
<p>“We have batteries, engineers, an advisor from Tesla and a customer in Tanzania who wants to launch these batteries across 250 villages where they’re doing massive education projects with tablets. I have all these pieces lined up, but I just need more money.”</p>
<p>Shiv recently returned to Chile, a home to some of his original reception via SeedStars World and Startup Chile, to put all focus into completing his prototype by the end of this year to fill orders.</p>
<p>“I’ve switched back to my 2013 mode and my $6 a day budget and doing paid work on the side. Like I said, I’ll quit when I only have $100 left in my pocket.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Shiv’s dream car is a Pagani Zonda R, but “in this lifetime” he will settle happily for a Subaru BRZ.  He loves the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin">The Adventures of Tin Tin</a>  and is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan’s</a> philosophy of “stepping beyond profits and balance sheets and moving the human race forward” &#8211; maybe by powering education in developing communities.</p>

<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://publicgood.com/">https://publicgood.com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/publicgood">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: June 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_664" style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jason-kunesh.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-664" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jason-kunesh-263x300.jpg" alt="Jason Kunesh, Public Good" width="263" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jason Kunesh,<a href="https://publicgood.com/"> Public Good</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Jason Kunesh is the co-founder and CEO of Public Good, a software company that helps organizations connect with civic supporters to raise money, inspire involvement and build community. He is passionate about product and technology design, social capital, community, and superheroes &#8211; both the kind that appear in comic books and the unheralded ones that serve our communities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On starting Public Good</b></span>:<br />
Social service has always played a significant role in Jason’s life &#8211; from being adopted as a child, to having a mother who was an active and beloved community volunteer, to joining the Obama re-election campaign’s technology team. The opportunity to work on the Obama campaign came at a time when Jason was examining how he wanted to re-allocate his time and skills to more impactful solutions besides “helping people get to cheaper spa days or flights”.</p>
<p>After the re-election was over, it was time to decide where to go next. The team realized that they wanted to continue what they started and apply their learnings. “It’s really 2.0 for us. We learned a lot of stuff on the campaign about what worked and what didn’t, and how different it was to model community relationships versus business relationships. We’re taking some of the same stuff we learned and applying it in new ways out of the political space and into the non-profit space.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On how technology facilitates social capital</b></span>:<br />
“The big thing is data. That was the biggest thing we tried to solve during the campaign. If we understand that you are the same person that showed up to an event, that engaged with us over Facebook, and came to the phone bank, then we have a much more complete picture of who you are and we can have a better and more respectful conversation with you.”</p>
<p>“There’s all this stuff that you can do (with technology) that is transactional, like donations and fundraising, but there’s additional stuff too. There are all these little things that can be useful &#8211; reading an article, sharing an article, voting, writing a letter &#8211; all these things that you can do. It’s all about how you connect people to realizing that all these little things actually matter, and you can track it.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“When it becomes apparent, it encourages change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Nonprofits are really good at 1:1 interaction, but haven’t been as good at using technology to emulate it. For example, if someone is excited enough to respond, I’m going to respond right away to show that I’m enthusiastic about hearing from them. During the campaign we learned that if someone got back to you in a couple of days, you were 80% more likely to come out and do something. If we waited a week, then you were under 20%. It’s the simple difference of being in the moment and getting excited.”</p>
<p>“The challenge with social impact and social capital work is instead of getting something in return, you are giving something away. To start, if we can at least show enthusiasm that you are part of a community and doing something, then that helps out.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“People who have been doing it a long time will say that they get more out of it than they give away. Once you realize the weird math of volunteerism, then people are hooked and will do stuff.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On design</span>:</b><br />
Jason references the philosophies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams">Dieter Rams</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek">Victor Papanek</a>, and Steve Jobs. He believes that design should provide frictionless solutions, be invisible to the user, and be intentional at every “layer of the onion.”</p>
<p>“I think design is getting into exciting places. In the early 20th century it was products, and then systems that created products, and now it’s about systems. We’re also starting to design behaviors &#8211; which is new. 50 years ago we designed flavors and scents, and now we’re trying to design actual behavior change &#8211; which is exciting.”</p>
<p>“Everybody is a designer and we just don’t realize it. We use tools and the tools are designed to give us super powers. I use this spoon so I can lift up liquid, and this fork to lift up the non-liquid things. These are my solutions. There’s always that idea of context and problem solving, and there’s always more than one tool. But, some are better than others.”</p>
<p>Jason gets a little bit existential as we talk about how design is the space and interaction created between the designer and the user. Then, we think about superheroes and how Batman is invisible, but in a loud way. And he finishes with utilitarian philosophy &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“As a user, you should know nothing of the person that created it. You should know that the object suits your desires and accomplishes your goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what’s exciting:</b></span><br />
“I’m excited that we (designers) have a seat at the table. That wasn’t the case for a long time. When I started 15 years ago, it was about self-definition. You came through the engineering door or the marketing door. There was no design door. Now we have a seat &#8211; so it is about what you do with that power and how do you help early designers figure that power out. You’re not a waiter, you’re a guide.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a fascinating box where you can do whatever you want &#8211; limited only by your skills and your imagination. If you can figure it out, you can do it.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Jason believes Chicago is the place to be for Public Good &#8211; “It’s a civic tech place. It’s a livable international city. It’s pragmatic &#8211; hard working, authentic, roll up our sleeves and get some stuff done. This is where it’s at in terms of nonprofits, foundations and innovation.” <a href="https://twitter.com/publicgood">Follow</a> how <a href="https://publicgood.com/">Public Good</a> is leveraging technology to engage with hundreds of organizations in Chicago and across the US to inspire people to take action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Riana Lynn<br />
<b>Company Description:</b> Technology platform that uses big data and small business user profiles to link food distributors, local farms and specialty food manufacturers with wholesale food buyers.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>:<a href="http://thefoodtrace.com/"> http://thefoodtrace.com/</a>;<a href="https://twitter.com/trace_food"> Twitter</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: February 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_589" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Riana-Lynn-2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-589" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Riana-Lynn-2-300x300.png" alt="Riana Lynn, Food Trace" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Riana Lynn, <a href="http://thefoodtrace.com/">FoodTrace</a><br />Art by <a href="http://nicklacke.tumblr.com/">Nick Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Riana Lynn is the CEO and Founder of FoodTrace, a software company that provides digital discovery and bridges the path between businesses to increase revenue opportunities for local food buyers (e.g, restaurants, grocery stores) looking for distributors, farms, and artisans. The software suite provides tools that improve operations by reporting ingredients, trends, and customer marketing to increase transparency of the resulting sourcing activities. She believes that technology is the answer to improving food access, health, and building a stronger local farming and food community.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On a life full of inspirations</b></span>:<br />
She was always inspired by her own family’s businesses and personal relationships with food. Her grandmother was an urban farmer in Evanston and taught Riana how to garden early on. “It was really impactful because it taught me about sustainability and decreasing food waste.” Her grandfather was a meat distributor and taught her how to hunt and took her to local markets where he sold his products. “It really changed my perspective on eating fresh and local; and the impact small farmers and artisans can have in their local community.”</p>
<p>When she was a teenager, she began to take notice and interest in internet businesses and the growth of e-commerce; and later in college, she taught herself how to code. “I started college the same year that Facebook started. To see a company like that grow and connect people was inspiring.”</p>
<p>Riana knew that she wanted to make an impact in food and health and guided her education and professional experiences with that in mind. She holds B.S. and Masters degrees in Biology, Chemistry and Public Health.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting to FoodTrace</b></span>:<br />
Her passion for technology, food and health continued to shape her projects and business pursuits after school. She had a series of interesting opportunities to get involved in government and health policy organizations, including a stint at the First Lady’s White House Kitchen Garden.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“All these experiences really molded me into understanding that there are solutions to improve access to food. However, I felt that my calling was to do something more agile and flexible than working in the government and hospital systems.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Riana wanted to use technology to create solutions faster. She began a consulting business that focused on e-commerce and digital strategies for local food artisans and had the early features of FoodTrace.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Quality sourcing and marketing your sourcing activities is very valuable for businesses. You’re not only bringing in good products and building relationships with vendors, but you’re able to share these activities with your customers who value more information and more choice on the kind of product and its background.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>She got noticed by the<a href="http://www.cnbcprime.com/the-profit/"> CNBC TV show, The Profit</a> through one of her consulting clients. Her consulting business was acquired in-house by the show host for the associated Investment Holdings group. Riana decided to continue pursuing her vision with the FoodTrace product concept after the acquisition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On learning how to code</b></span>:<br />
“It takes time. You can take classes that are accelerated, but just testing out different platforms and languages a couple hours a day or a week can get you a long way.”</p>
<p>For founders who don’t have any coding knowledge, she suggests that you should acquire some basic knowledge and a mentor who can help you navigate the space.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“If you’re an entrepreneur, you should try to learn it on a basic level so that you can understand how to communicate with people who can take your company to the next level. Every company is tech-enabled now.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On passion and appetite</b></span>:<br />
Riana believes the two most important traits for success are passion and appetite.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“You just need to be consuming all the time. If you don’t have an appetite for continuing to grow and learning all the tools that are making businesses better, then it’s going to be hard to survive. If you really find a project that you are passionate about, I think the appetite will develop because you really want to impact that area and see your brain child grow. If it’s not there, then you’re probably not passionate enough about that issue or subject. The passion drives that appetite. If you don’t feel it, you might be misaligned about what you think you’re passionate about.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what’s most important for women in tech</b></span>:<br />
“Definitely community. I’ve learned so much from people and have a sisterhood of support to learn from. Sharing your knowledge and resources is very valuable. I think the biggest struggle right now is around capital, but I think we can join together to figure out how to raise capital more collectively.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have to be more collaborative than our counterparts &#8211; even if we’re competing for the same pot of money. If we share, then we’ll all have more success.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what else she’s learned along the way</b></span>:<br />
“Don’t schedule too much stuff. You have to wake up earlier. You have to do work on the weekends. And you also have to drink wine and whiskey with your friends. You have to celebrate the small things. You have to relax with your family.”</p>
<hr />
<p>At the time of the interview, FoodTrace was currently in beta and planning to fully launch in the spring. You can find Riana eating at<a href="http://rasdashenchicago.com/"> Ras Dashen</a> restaurant, local taquerias and anywhere with good brussel sprouts, fresh fruit, great spices and hand crafted cocktails. She loves the Edgewater Farmers Market in Chicago, but recommends that you take a Saturday trip out to Madison, WI some time to experience the the Madison Farmers Market at Capitol Square.</p>
<p>In March 2015, Google &#8211; <a href="http://www.code2040.org/">Code2040</a> announced that Riana was one of 3 individuals chosen for their inaugural class of <a href="http://www.code2040.org/news/2015/3/16/announcing-our-first-class-of-code2040-entrepreneurs-in-residence">Entrepreneurs in Residence</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founders</b>: Eliad Inbar, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: Interactive software that adds size, look and feel context to online retail shopping<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: http://tangiblee.com/; <a href="https://twitter.com/TangibleView">Twitter</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: December 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_566" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Inbar-final-web.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-566" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Inbar-final-web-300x294.jpg" alt="Eliad Inbar, Tangiblee" width="300" height="294" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eliad Inbar, <a href="http://tangiblee.com/">Tangiblee</a><br />Art by <a href="http://johnroseillustration.com/">John Rose</a></p></div>
<p>Eliad Inbar is the co-founder of Tangiblee. He came to Chicago last summer after Tangiblee was accepted to the 2014 class of Tech Stars. Eliad believes he is a lucky guy in life and that people can affect their luck by being open to and seizing opportunities &#8211; such as Tangiblee.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the idea</b></span><b>:</b><br />
The idea first came about when Eliad was buying earrings for his wife online. When he actually got them they were much bigger than he expected &#8211; so much so that he did not keep them. He encountered more and more stories of people buying a variety of items online that were not the right size or fit, and as a result, the concept of Tangiblee was born.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of ideas that come to you when you’re in startups, but some of them just stick. We knew this was going to be good for consumers &#8211; we just needed to figure out how to sell it. Every time we pitched the idea someone would say, ‘You know, that happened to me.’”</p>
<p>“We just couldn’t let this idea go. 10-20 years from now, there’s going to be a better way to visualize products than we have today. This is the evolutionary next step  &#8211; showing it in context, next to things you already know. It relates to how we already think. You use something you know and compare it. It’s natural.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting into Tech Stars and the experience</b></span>:<br />
Tech Stars wasn’t initially on Tangiblee’s initial radar, but a friend introduced them to it and they decided to just go for it. They did all their applications and interviews remotely from Israel via Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>“Most of the big things that happen to you in your life &#8211; you don’t plan them. I didn’t think it was going to be this fast. It’s been a life changing event. It was a pretty easy decision to come here. These are opportunities we couldn’t have gotten in Israel  &#8211; business development, investor exposure, trying what we do in a big market.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Coming to Techstars was the best decision we made. It has improved us in every parameter of the business.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On choosing a co-founder</b></span>:<br />
“We’ve known each other for 6-7 years and worked together in the same room at a previous company. We started throwing around ideas and eventually found one we wanted to go for. We’re very different &#8211; but we are complete in terms of things we bring to the table.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most things you can’t control, but choosing a co-founder is the thing you can control. If you choose right or wrong &#8211; it will have a lot of impact on the business. So luckily, we both chose right.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting the first investors and customers</b></span>:<br />
For Tangiblee, it has been about getting your network to take a bet and keeping them happy about the bet they are taking.</p>
<p>“We learned that network is super important. The way you present your business is so important. It’s not just about presenting it to the outside, it affects how you think about business internally.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t imagine that fundraising would go as it did &#8211; it was very quick thanks to the lessons we learned about presenting our company, showing what’s important and focusing on the right progress.  When we went to investors at the end of the summer they saw serious progress &#8211; they are betting on something that has a good chance.”</p>
<p>“It (getting customers) was a combination of luck, network and people who just loved our product. Your first customers don’t know if it’s going to work, but they really like what your product is representing. You need someone to take a bet; and after they take the bet you need them to be happy about it.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On advice</b></span>:<br />
Eliad is careful and humble to say that he’s not qualified to give advice necessarily, but he is working on and believes in the following-</p>
<p>“Take things in proportion. That’s something I still need to work on. Another thing you learn is just to get used to getting out of your comfort zone on a daily basis, even an hourly basis. If you don’t do that you’re not going to enjoy the ride and you have to enjoy the ride.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most of it is the ride &#8211; I don’t know how the ride will end. You have to enjoy the ride because it is one hell of a ride.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At the time of the interview, Tangiblee had just closed its first round of funding and was buckling down for their first winter in Chicago. “I hadn’t been to Chicago before, but I really like it. It’s exactly what I want. Everyone is trying to scare me about winter, but I’m not worried.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Rajesh Karmani<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: Zero Percent is a technology platform that connects food retailers with food charities to donate and pick-up food surplus in a simple, reliable and safe way.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="http://zeropercent.us/">http://zeropercent.us/</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeropercentus">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/zeropercentus">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zeropercent.cmi">Facebook</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: November 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_375" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-20-RajKarmani.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-375" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-20-RajKarmani-227x300.jpg" alt="Raj Karmani, Zero Percent" width="227" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Raj Karmani, <a href="http://zeropercent.us/">Zero Percent</a><br />Art by <a href="http://simplyerika.com/Erika ">Erika Swanson</a></p></div>
<p>Raj Karmani came to the United States from Pakistan to study Computer Science.  He intended to, “get an advanced degree in Computer Science, come to the United States and work for the best technology companies out there.” While finishing his PhD, he realized that he could instead use his expertise to make a serious social impact &#8211; reduce food waste with the help of technology and modern logistics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the idea</b></span>:</p>
<p>After a conversation with his local Einstein Bros. Bagels manager about throwing away food, he saw an opportunity for online marketplace technology to close the gap between food retailers and food charities. He began exploring and researching the idea, and was surprised to learn just how big the problem of food waste actually was.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;You can use technology to not just help solve the problem, but to scale the solution. The potential impact you could make kept driving me towards Zero Percent.”</i><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why Zero Percent can kick this problem</b></span>:</p>
<p>“My hypothesis was/is that technology and modern logistics can make it really efficient, reliable and safe to move excess fresh food &#8211; nutritious food, prepared food &#8211; between the source and the charities. Traditional food donation is only shelf stable food. That was the bedrock and ensured people weren’t starving &#8211; but we can go a step farther by using technology and modern logistics.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On going all in</b></span>:</p>
<p>Raj built the technology platform for Zero Percent while continuing with his PhD program. While still in Urbana-Champaign, he received interest and partnered with a national non-profit there. He decided to “go with the flow” and see where the momentum of Zero Percent could go.</p>
<p>The inflection point was when he applied to <a href="http://theimpactengine.com/">Impact Engine </a>in Chicago, the accelerator program focusing on for-profit businesses addressing social challenges. After being granted the interview, the original plan was to have Raj do a video-conference interview. At the last minute, Raj left Urbana-Champaign at 6am in the morning and drove straight to Chicago &#8211; arriving at 9:05am for his 9:00am interview. Even though he ran in a little late, he suspects that “seeing my passion and commitment was one of the reasons we were selected.&#8221;</p>
<p>After being selected to Impact Engine, he knew that “coming to Chicago, working with the best entrepreneurs, getting some funding &#8211; that was the platform I needed to have the best shot at scaling this, at solving the problem.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I had to go all in.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On being a social enterprise</span>:</b></p>
<p>There are some unique considerations and legislative frameworks involved in being a for-profit social enterprise. One of the challenges for both the startups and the investors is quantifying the impact. Raj talks about how investors are used to studying financial statements, but now they are being educated about a new line item on the balance sheet &#8211; the impact. That is why being a part of Impact Engine was so critical for him &#8211;  “They are creating an ecosystem of social entrepreneurship and bringing in investors who are looking to make a social impact”.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On what keeps food retailers from signing-up</span>:</b></p>
<p>It sounds like a win-win for all parties involved &#8211; food retailers donate food and get a tax deduction, food charities receive better food, more people are being fed and Zero Percent can be a sustainable business. So what’s the hold up?</p>
<p>Raj says it is about educating business owners and about making it operationally easier for them to enforce the changes. “They have to communicate to their staff. Throwing it away is the easiest thing, so there is an operational barrier. Every day our team thinks about how we can make it easier than throwing it away for restaurants. There’s no blame game here, it’s just about understanding your user to make it easier for them.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On what individual consumers can do to reduce food waste</span>:</b></p>
<p>“Consumers can do two simple things. 1) Look inside their fridges and think about how they can buy smart, use smart and store smart so they have less food waste in their homes. 2) Consumers can also make an impact at the retail level just by nudging. Inquire at your local restaurant or grocery store about what they do with their food excess. By inquiring, it will put a thought into the mind of the businesses and they care if their customers care.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Zero Percent is currently focusing on reducing food waste in Chicago and then will continue to expand wherever it needs to get closer to zero percent food waste. When you go home today, take a look in your kitchen and think “buy smart, use smart and store smart.”</p>

<p>Jay Savsani  used to build startup MVPs for other people’s dreams. “When people ask me if Meal Sharing is my first startup.. I’m like, ‘It’s my… 40th?’” A few years ago he decided he had found his own dream he was ready to realize &#8211; creating an online platform that brings hosts and guests together over home-cooked meals around the world.</p>
<p>He sat down with me and “just flowed” about how he loves sharing economies, is a little delusional and believes in the power of a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the home cooked meal that changed everything</b></span>:</p>
<p>Jay has told this story many times. He was traveling in Cambodia with his cousin and wanted to eat somewhere where the locals ate, somewhere authentic. He says that it’s the stories where you travel afar, meet someone random and do something underground that give you “street cred.”</p>
<p>“We’d only gone to the Navy Pier equivalents so far and I thought, ‘We did NOT just travel to the other side of the world to do that.&#8217; For years, we used to just turn to the Lonely Planet. Congratulations! You’re eating NEXT to locals, but you’re not eating WITH locals.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Where are they eating? Duh, they’re eating in their homes.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So he goes to the front-desk of the hotel and tells the guy he’s looking for a home cooked meal. “So he brought 15-20 people into the hotel lobby and asked who would have me over for dinner. I felt so flattered &#8211; they were fighting over me. There was a reciprocated curiosity of them wanting to meet me and me wanting to meet them.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On doing what it takes to prove your concept</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>“So I came back to Chicago with an idea and I got obsessed with the sharing economy at large. I read up on ANYTHING about it. I just went wild. This was just 3 years ago. Now Airbnb is ‘cool’ &#8211; but I was hosting on Airbnb when people were like, ‘Why? That’s weird.’ This was prior to Lyft and Uber &#8211; I just wanted to learn everything about the sharing economy.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I would take my car and go to Bears games or Lollapalooza and be like, ‘Hey! I’m cheaper than a cab and it’ll be way more fun! &#8211; Hop in!’”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Jay even ran split tests for himself. He would try to pick people up in his car by himself, and he would try to do it again with his girlfriend in the car and compare the differences in responses. “There was no data yet. If there is no data, you just  create it.” In addition, he turned to Craigslist to see how people would react to home cooked meal invitations via an online platform. “I was just posting on Craigslist, on a non-trusted network!”</p>
<p>To take it a step even further, once things started to really materialize, he told his team of programmers and designers, “48 hours &#8211; pack your bags. We’re getting in my car to go across the United States to meal share, to learn about what this is.” “We went on a month long road trip of basically only eating through meal sharing. From NYC to Boston to Cleveland to Raleigh&#8230; We were proving to ourselves that we had something real that people wanted to do and that WE wanted to do. The group of people we met along the way kind of set the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It was such an awesome slice of America and life &#8211; through food. Everyone had a unique story.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the magic of home cooking</b></span>:</p>
<p>So why is home cooking so much better than just meeting your friends at a restaurant? “I think everyone knows home cooking is better. There’s a certain level of honesty. This is my home &#8211; this is where I eat, sleep and interact with my family and friends. It’s not removed. It’s authentic.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Jay speaks about the ability home cooking has to build a sense of community. He says that he knows people who have found new jobs, significant others and friends through a Meal Sharing experience. He even tells a story of a host whose apartment flooded and his Meal Sharing community came out to help him afterwards.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The power of the meal helps the community.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Jay points out that generally speaking, home cooking is healthier. “We never assault our bodies the way a food establishment does that cooks for volume. I view it as the Etsy of home cooking. It is small batch creation. Home cooking is a liaison to better health.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On what ‘they’ don’t tell you and what you should know</b></span>:</p>
<p>“I don’t want to give the standard &#8211; make sure you’re passionate and follow your hearts! Those are the givens. It’s really a balance between being completely delusional and being real about what you want to do.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;If you’re truly creating something from nothing, you have to be a bit delusional.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“When you’re starting a startup everything is stacked against you. All you’re trying to do whenever you’re hacking is reduce that percentage however you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look for something with a polarizing effect. Our goal isn’t to be a watered down version of something where people say, ‘Meal Sharing is okay. It’s alright.&#8217;’’ Some people have told Jay that Meal Sharing is the best thing and they’ve been waiting for it all their lives, and others have told him it is the worst idea ever. He’s okay with that. In fact, he welcomes it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wrapping it up, Jay shares a his hopeful mission for Meal Sharing: &#8220;We want to change how people eat and how people go on vacation forever.”</p>

<b>Date of interview</b>: November 2014</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_349" style="width: 343px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neal-sales-griffin.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-349" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neal-sales-griffin-300x262.jpg" alt="Neal Sales-Griffin, Starter League" width="333" height="291" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Neal Sales-Griffin, <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">Starter League</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Neal Sales-Griffin is the CEO and co-founder of Starter League, a first-of-kind innovative and immersive programming school in Chicago.  For Neal, the motivation, journey and vision of Starter League is not just about teaching people to code &#8211; it’s about solving meaningful problems, helping people find happiness and making a positive impact. He believes that you can learn how to code (as he did) and that it will enable you to achieve big things.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On developing his point of view and mission statement</span>:</b></p>
<p>Growing up, Neal thought the most important problem to solve was making money. However, while studying at Northwestern, he began to develop a different point of view and mantra for how he wanted to approach life. “It’s not because I’m trying to make money. That’s not what’s driving me anymore. I came to this aha moment. I realized that for me it was about happiness &#8211; I wanted to enjoy my life and I derived the most happiness when helping people. I enjoyed most of what I did when I was doing something that added value to other folks in the world.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong><i>Once i knew that, I just became very committed to figuring that out every step of the way. I refused to settle by doing something that only felt half right or not right.”</i></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Wake up and ask yourself, ‘What are you doing today?’ Are you on a path where you are inspiring others and enabling others to to be more awesome at whatever they’re trying to do? If not, time to move on. If so, keep plugging away.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On &#8211; why software?</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>While in college, he took a job as an analyst for a venture capital firm. He helped assess businesses looking for investors and realized that the majority of the companies were software based. He felt ignorant and frustrated that he was making recommendations about companies that he didn&#8217;t fully understand. “That’s the important part (product development). You can’t just skip that part. That wasn’t good enough for me.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>End to end, I wanted to understand it because I knew that a better product and better value can be brought to people if we understand the end to end process. Once I realized that was the missing piece for me, I decided to drop everything. That’s what led me to software.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On challenges in software development and startups</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>What comes naturally to Neal is identifying problems to solve. “There’s no fear that I’m not going to have something meaningful to work on. Honestly, there’s too much. There’s so much about the world that can be improved and made better.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I’m not going to run out of opportunities to pursue things to make better. I feel like I’ve unlocked some secret that’s hiding in plain sight.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>“The hardest part is actually figuring out how to apply it to something of value. Not just coming up with an idea, but actually producing the solution in a way that accomplishes the goal and produces the outcome the person you’re trying to help ultimately wants. That’s the part I’ve been obsessing over”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><strong> </strong></strong><i>I think too many people are focused on the superficial aspects of being in this space. I think there’s something deeper that’s more important &#8211; are you charged up by what you’re doing, so that no matter the solution, you’ll stay committed to the problem?”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On Mike as his co-founder</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>Throughout past jobs and interactions, Neal confesses that sometimes he “felt like an alien.”</p>
<p>“I’ve developed a set of beliefs about all of this in my life and I found it hard for a lot of people to understand. That’s why I formed a small group of people to interact with &#8211; to challenge me, to challenge them and to confide in with these ideas”.</p>
<p>Among this group of confidants and like-minded individuals is his co-founder, Mike McGee. “We had a number of people involved along the way, but Mike and I ended up emerging from the smoke as partners and co-founders. I’m really lucky to have Mike. He’s one of the few people that I’ve worked with in my life who is not only able to match, but even exceed my energy and work ethic. We also have very similar values &#8211; they’re very much aligned. That value alignment is the most crucial part of having a partner.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why Chicago is special</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>“I love Chicago because the culture is still malleable. Chicago is still trying to figure it out and battling different ideas. I’m very interested in being a part of that &#8211; of contributing and helping figure that out. I’ve always been interested in shaping culture. I think of some of the stuff I’ve shared with you this morning, and those are some of the beliefs I’d like to share with more people. I’d like more businesses to be created with those values mind &#8211; helping people, solving problems, being fulfilled everyday because you’re pursuing your own happiness which is derived from helping others. That’s what I want Chicago to be.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On most memorable moment</span>:</b></p>
<p>“That’s tough because I operate in the now. What’s most exciting to me right now is what I’m about to do in 30 minutes &#8211; work with those students. If I step outside that for a second, I’d say the opportunity that I had to connect with and befriend the wonderful team over at <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. That meant a lot to me. I can’t believe it happened. It is cool that somebody that I idolized has indicated to me that he believes in me &#8211; in what I’m doing, in what we’re doing as a team and why we’re doing it.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On why Starter League over other opportunities</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>Neal had the opportunity to go to Uruguay and work for a company while learning how to code and also was given a job offer to work on the Obama campaign. He turned both of these down to create Starter League. “It boiled down to what’s the most meaningful thing we could be doing right now. What are we in the most unique position to contribute? I knew there were people out there who probably felt the way I felt. They were wrestling with ideas in their heads but felt limited because they couldn’t express what they wanted to make and turn it into something real.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Our intention is to give people a set of skills along with identifying the intrinsic motivation that allows them to continue growing and developing outside our walls and to make sure what they’re learning is applied to ideas that make the world move forward in a positive way.”</em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In closing, Neal offers some simple advice on learning and self-improvement &#8211; “I  just do things. I try to do things I don’t know how to do. That’s how you learn. It’s nothing complicated.”</p>

<b>Company Description</b>: FitnessCubed makes Cubii, an under-desk elliptical trainer with the goal of fighting the sitting disease common in today’s working lifestyle.<br />

<b>Date of interview</b>: October 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_271" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ShivaniJain.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-271" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ShivaniJain-300x291.jpg" alt="Shivani Jain, FitnessCubed" width="300" height="291" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shivani Jain, <a href="http://www.fitnesscubed.com/">FitnessCubed</a><br />Art by <a href="http://whimsicalworldofcj.wordpress.com/"> Chasity &#8220;CJ&#8221; Hampton</a></p></div>
<p><b>Shivani Jain</b> is the Chief Marketing Officer and one of three co-founders of FitnessCubed. While doing her undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago, she met her co-founders Arnav and Ryota. They started working on the concept through the University of Chicago’s College New Venture challenge, and when they won in the summer of 2012, they knew they were onto something.</p>
<p>After graduating, she and her co-founders all took full-time corporate jobs, and worked on FitnessCubed on nights and weekends. In June 2014, they participated in NeoCon, North America’s largest design exposition that takes place at Chicago’s Merchandise Mart. Right after that, they officially launched their Kickstarter campaign with a goal of funding $80K to help ‘“kickstart” Cubii manufacturing. They over-reached their goal hitting almost $300K.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The moment I remember the most was after NPR did an article &#8211; that night we were getting a new backer every millisecond. It went viral! It was really exciting.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Since then the team has been riding the momentum from the feedback and interest they’ve received and is working on investor meetings, product design, manufacturing, and increasing and targeting marketing efforts to get the first production line of Cubii orders out in time for 2015 New Year resolutions.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On choosing KickStarter, crowd-funding and customer interest</span>:</b></p>
<p>“We needed to validate the idea. The hardware space is a lot more risky than software because it requires so much more working capital to get started. We knew we needed to get more feedback and validation. We chose KickStarter specifically because it has so much volume already as a crowd-funding platform.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;More than the funds, we needed to see what peoples&#8217; reactions would be and  if they were willing to pay for it.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The customer interest and numbers help us go to investors and give us confidence that people are interested in buying this. Without marketing, we get at least 2-3 orders/day. It means there is a need. It puts a lot of pressure on us to deliver a spectacular product &#8211; people are trusting us. It’s not an expensive item compared to other products, but it’s not pocket change.”</p>
<p>At the time of the interview, there were 1500 Cubiis on back order.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On manufacturing challenges</span>:</b></p>
<p>The trio of founders were all science and liberal arts majors, with no experience or education in manufacturing products &#8211; so how did they figure out how to actually make a product?</p>
<p>“(Manufacturing experience) was probably the biggest challenge we experienced and still experience. It’s exciting because it forces us to self-learn. In college we were lucky to have had a lot of access to people willing to help us through professors, mentors and the accelerator program.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;You have to be very proactive. You have to seek advice on anything and everything.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On being in Chicago</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>“We plugged into maker communities in Chicago &#8211; people who have launched and made products before and have connections to manufacturers. We continuously seek their advice. When we started, there weren’t many hardware startups in Chicago &#8211; it is increasing now. The communities we became a part of have doubled since we joined.”</p>
<p>“From the Health and Wellness side, it’s the place to be. You have easy access to big hospitals, it’s crowded with health companies and now there are health and wellness accelerators in addition to organizations like Illinois Healthiest Employers and Vitality Institute. We’re fortunate we launched here.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On being an entrepreneur</b></span>:</p>
<p>“ I knew I wanted to have a business of my own &#8211; I just didn’t know I wanted to do it this soon. I envisioned that I would work for a couple of years and start a business later. But the idea got so much traction that we just fell into it. It just kind of happened. I think that sometimes if you try too hard to make it happen it doesn’t. There are a lot of factors &#8211; luck, timing, resources, supportive parents.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On advice for others</span>:</b></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Trust your instinct.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We had so many mentors and we had lots of opinions. One can get lost and lose the vision of what you wanted to do in the first place. Go with your instinct and what you want to do. As a founder, you have the luxury to stick to what you want. You of course should value what people say, but don’t follow everything. You can get delayed if you start questioning everything &#8211; everyone will have an opinion, but not everyone will be right.  It is very basic advice, but it is something we learned and we’ve been learning”</p>
<hr />
<p>We hang around a little longer and talk about her personal fitness preferences. Her and the other founders weren’t using their own Cubii yet since prototype manufacturing was still in progress and the one they had was so expensive that they were afraid to touch it! She most enjoys jogging along the lake and walking over taking public transit, at least until the snow comes. In terms of what else employers and companies can do to support the health and wellness of their employees (besides buy everyone a Cubii) &#8211; she believes that if people would just GET UP and stop sitting by having walking and standing meetings, then we are taking a step in the right direction.</p>

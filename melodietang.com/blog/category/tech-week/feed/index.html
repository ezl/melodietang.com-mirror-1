<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Company Description</strong>: Platform of tools to ‘discover your inner awesome.’</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Site</strong>:</span><a href="http://www.idealemon.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.idealemon.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ideaLemon"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/ideaLemon</span></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Interview Date</strong>: August 2015</span></p>
<div id="attachment_723" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/martin-rajiv.png"><img class="wp-image-723 size-large" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/martin-rajiv-1024x516.png" alt="Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan, Idea Lemon" width="610" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan,<a href="http://www.idealemon.com/"> Idea Lemon</a><br /> Art by Francesco DiBattista</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin and Rajiv are the co-founders of Idea Lemon, a platform of tools to help you ‘discover your inner awesome’. They are optimistic about the lifestyle you are empowered to create by pivoting your inner dialogue, pinpointing your mission and purpose, and turning your ideas into actions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On turning an idea into action</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin and Rajiv were co-founders of the DePaul marketing club in college. After graduation, they both realized how dissatisfying and ineffective the average networking event was and decided to “create our own platform where we can learn what we want to learn and connect with the people we want to connect with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning, they only focused on small ‘knowledge working events’ where they chose a dedicated topic for each event to guide conversation and interactions. They observed how the format successfully guided people to explore themselves and connect with others at a deeper level, which ended up evolving into a study in personal branding. They launched their first personal branding workshop via</span><a href="https://dabble.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dabble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and called it, ‘Discover Your Inner Awesome.’ Since then, they have also launched an Idea Lemon Podcast, been VIPs at <a href="http://techweek.com/">Tech Week</a>, and are launching a new online course soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On personal branding through mission and purpose</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
“It’s really about figuring out the core of what you believe in as a person and using that to structure how you think about yourself, talk about yourself, and the lifestyle you want to live. What is your definition of success? How do you know when you’ve made it? The pursuit of answering those big questions is what leads to the development of everything that we’re doing. We want to help other people answer those questions and use those questions to explore who they are, what their brand is, and figure out what they want to accomplish in their life.” (Martin)</p>
<p>“Everything that you do and care about comes down to two driving forces &#8211; A mission and a purpose. We teach people how to find that, and once you find it you realize that, instead of being a pawn in the chess game, you can become the chess master.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On telling your story</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
Both Martin and Rajiv brand themselves as ‘storytellers’. How does that tie back to helping others find and action what they want?</p>
<p>“Look at everything that people gravitate towards &#8211; it is the story. People want a hero, a villain, and a plot. That’s basically how life is constructed as well. You make yourself out to be the heroes of your own life. There are villains along the way, climaxes, and valleys. We’re telling you to architect your story. You’re playing a character in your own life &#8211; where do you want to take the story?” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“There are two sides of storytelling. There’s the external one you tell other people and there is the internal one you tell yourself. I love the internal story because changing your internal monologue really does change your life. Whatever it is you’re telling yourself that you can’t do &#8211; if you can change that mindset then you can actually change your life and you can bring it to your external voice as well. We try to help people change their inner stories so that when they tell their stories it is actually something they believe, and they are telling an authentic story that connects them to people and opportunities.”(Martin)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the power of projects</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
One of the tools to achieving your ‘inner awesome’ is to execute projects with intention, purpose, and pride.</p>
<p>“You either need to be totally cool with the life you’re living, or you need to start creating something. Side projects aren’t necessarily about financial needs. It’s about all the intangibles that come with it. It’s the benefit of getting up and going out there and doing something.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“It is defeating that you can’t be confident in the things you enjoy. Usually when you’re talking to someone, the thing that they’re doing 20% of the time is the thing they look forward to doing the most &#8211; so why not get the most out of it? Why not use it to fuel and architect the lifestyle you want or the career you want?” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“Once you switch your mindset from, ‘This is something I do on the side that I can’t talk to you about’, to, ‘This is something that I love, and I want you to know about it, and I want to meet other people who love it,’ then everything changes. You’re no longer someone who is embarrassed about the things you enjoy in your life. It’s sad that at some point in your life you’re taught that you’re not really allowed to enjoy that thing because it’s not your full time job.” (Martin)</p>
<p>“Create the opportunity that you want for yourself. Don’t wait for permission, don’t wait for someone else to hand it to you. Side projects allow you to create your own opportunities. That&#8217;s why we’re launching an online course  &#8211;  to help people launch side projects so they can create and capture that opportunity.” (Rajiv)</p>
<hr />
<p>What mission and purpose does the duo seek for themselves through all this?</p>
<p>“My mission is to shape my life to find the most authentic version of myself in my surroundings. My purpose is to take what I learn and tell stories with it. That’s my way of finding that most authentic version.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“My mission and purpose is that I want to understand ideas that are different than my own. The way that I do that is through experimentation and testing. I like to take ideas and turn them into real things for people.” (Martin)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find Martin and Rajiv finishing their epic summer road trip with</span><a href="http://www.under30experiences.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under 30 Experiences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Founder</b>: Jimmy Odom<br />
<b>Company Description</b>: WeDeliver brings on demand delivery to neighborhood businesses.<br />
<b>Company Site</b>: <a title="http://www.wedeliver.us/" href="http://www.wedeliver.us/">http://www.wedeliver.us/</a><br />
<b>Date of interview</b>: October 2014</p>
<div id="attachment_176" style="width: 244px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jimmy-odom-we-deliver.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-176" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jimmy-odom-we-deliver-215x300.jpg" alt="Jimmy Odom, We Deliver" width="234" height="327" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jimmy Odom, <a href="https://www.wedeliver.us/">We Deliver</a><br />Art by <a href="http://lukemart.in/">Luke Martin</a> of <a href="http://www.wtlcomic.com/"> What the L?! comics</a> and more</p></div>
<p>Jimmy wasn&#8217;t my first interview, but I wanted to lead with him for a few reasons. Firstly, because it was this coffee date that gave me the idea of the site name. But other than that, he is just so electric and passionate &#8211; it seemed like an obvious opening post.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On figuring out what he wanted to do</b></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I have a different view on life and careers than most people. I think if you’re good at one thing, you can be good at anything. Throughout my life, I have come across things that I was really passionate about and that I really enjoyed. I’m driven by passion. That’s what gets me excited, that’s what gets me up every morning. </i><em>It’s totally random &#8211; it touches my heart and I become passionate about it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(You can read from <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130205/BLOGS11/130209922/how-wedeliver-is-taking-a-page-from-airbnb-and-lyft">Crain’s</a> and <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/25005698-418/jimmy-odom-uses-his-drive-to-deliver.html">Chicago Sun Times</a> that he has a diverse past exploring careers in culinary arts, screenwriting, and even emergency medicine.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On entrepreneurship and ideation</b></span><b>:</b></p>
<p>I asked him if he always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He looks at me and explains that it wasn’t about wanting it, he has just always been one.</p>
<p>“I’ve always done it. I was that kid on my block who organized all the basketball tournaments. I was always doing it, I just didn’t know there was a term for it. I do wish someone had identified me as I grew up. I’m learning now, but I think it could’ve honed my skills a little more at an early age. I’m so glad that entrepreneurship is actually being encouraged in the school system now. Not everyone is going to be an entrepreneur, but we all have the ability to be one.”</p>
<p>In terms of his ideas &#8211; they “just happen”. He doesn&#8217;t have a special process for it, he doesn&#8217;t sit around and brainstorm and they’re not always triggered by anything.</p>
<p>“They just come. It’s been like this all my life. They just come. I could be sitting at home doing absolutely nothing that has to do with my idea. Just happens.” (Good luck trying to replicate that, people.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On coming up with WeDeliver</b></span>:</p>
<p>While he was working for Apple (a job he says he absolutely loved), he went to Stanford Startup School and came back on an inspirational high.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I came back and I was just on fire for entrepreneurship, and on fire for technology. Being surrounded by some of the smartest people in the world… that was electrifying and invigorating.&#8221; </i></p></blockquote>
<p>He knew he wanted to build something, but it was just a matter of what. He thought of it after his mother asked him to pick up a prescription for her.</p>
<p>“The pharmacy was right next to the pizza delivery place. It just didn&#8217;t make sense. Why doesn&#8217;t it (on demand delivery) exist? Let’s build it. Simply put- it was just the right place at the right time and I knew I wanted to do this.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On building a team</b></span>:</p>
<p>Jimmy doesn&#8217;t consider building a team to be a traditional hiring process.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If you look at the creation of the planets &#8211; there are just interactions, collisions and chaos. And from chaos, comes order.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_56" style="width: 417px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image.png"><img class="wp-image-56" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image.png" alt="Illustration by Alexa Tang" width="407" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by Alexa Tang</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Developing a team in the early stages &#8211; those were just collisions &#8211; meeting people in the environment and seeing who you stick with through gravitational pulls. That’s how we all met. It wasn&#8217;t probably until employee 15 that I started to think more strategically about who comes into the company and what role they will fill. That is something I had to change in terms of how I look at growing the company.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On getting customers</b></span>:</p>
<p>“I literally went from door to door down Chicago avenue.”</p>
<p>Now that he has customers, his approach is still the same except that WeDeliver is getting a good amount of referral business as well. “If you want to build a business that empowers local businesses you need to get out, you need to talk to them, you need to see them, you need to meet them. I like to have a relationship with you.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On handling rejection</span>:</b><br />
<i></i></p>
<p>“Each time it was good to reinforce that I’m not doing this to get into an event, I’m not doing this to get into a competition, I’m doing this because I see this business growing and I like my customers. I love what we do. Those other things are ancillary, they’re extra. It’s not the substance of the cake &#8211; it’s just frosting. It was so important for us to get back into the right mind set. It is all a mindset and how you think.”</p>
<p>(WeDeliver did NOT get into Tech Week or Tech Starters the first time around.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On advice ‘they’ don’t tell you</b></span>:</p>
<p>Apparently it is all about trusting yourself and learning from the right sci-fi hero.</p>
<p>“It’s so important for entrepreneurs to truly trust their instincts &#8211; to believe in themselves. We look at those that have built companies and think that whatever they know is better than what I know, whatever they&#8217;ve done is better than what I&#8217;ve done. I&#8217;ve met a ton of mentors over the last 2 years and each potential mentor comes and assesses a problem as if they have first hand knowledge of everything. You see something others don’t see &#8211; that’s why you’re the innovator. You see further down the road and you see what others don’t see &#8211; or else they would have built it. Trust the vision. Others can help shape it, but you have to trust your vision. <b> </b>If you can align mission, vision and purpose with metrics &#8211; then some really interesting things happen.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“I find inspiration everywhere.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Do you watch the show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)">Heroes</a>? Two of the most powerful characters of the show are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylar">Sylar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Petrelli">Peter</a>. Sylar has to be hands on and dirty to accumulate abilities and become the all powerful villain. Peter just has to be next to you &#8211; just in your presence and he can get your ability. That’s what I want to be like. As an entrepreneur, I want to surround myself with amazing people so that the more I’m around them &#8211; I can see their skill set, see what makes them special, learn from them, and make them part of my team.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;‘Become like Peter Petrelli.’ &#8211; We’ll make bumper stickers of that.”</em></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<p>Jimmy starts telling me a story after I&#8217;ve stopped recording and while he’s grabbing for his iPhone. He tells me that yesterday he left his iPhone on the train. After realizing he left it, he begins to track it via the GPS in his phone. He continues to drive next to the train that has his phone and realizes that his phone got off the train and has gone to an actual physical address. Against his wife’s advice, he decides he will see this to the end. He walks up to the door, rings the doorbell, asks for his phone back, gets it back and goes on with his day. I think this story represents his general spirit &#8211; he <b>sees</b> it, he <b>cares</b> about it, he goes to <b>get it</b>.</p>

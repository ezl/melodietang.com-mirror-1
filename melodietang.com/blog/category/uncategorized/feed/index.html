				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Eliad Inbar, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Interactive software that adds size, look and feel context to online retail shopping<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://tangiblee.com/">tangiblee.com</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/TangibleView">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: December 2014</p>
<p>Eliad Inbar is the co-founder of Tangiblee. He came to Chicago last summer after Tangiblee was accepted to the 2014 class of Tech Stars. Eliad believes he is a lucky guy in life and that people can affect their luck by being open to and seizing opportunities &#8211; such as Tangiblee.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the idea</strong></span>:<br />
The idea was inspired by Eliad&#8217;s experience buying earrings for his wife online. When he actually got them they were way bigger than he expected and he had to return them. The idea kept growing as they continued to encounter more and more stories of people buying a variety of items online that were not the size or fit they expected. “Every time we pitched the idea someone would say, ‘Ya know, that happened to me.’ ”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“There are a lot of ideas that come to you when you’re in startups, but some of them just stick. We knew this was going to be good for consumers &#8211; we just needed to figure out how to sell it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We just couldn’t let this idea go. 10-20 years from now, there’s going to be a better way to visualize products than we have today. This is the evolutionary next step to what we have today &#8211; showing it in context, next to things you already know. It relates to how we already think. You use something you know and compare it. It’s natural.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On getting into Tech Stars and the experience</strong></span>:<br />
Tech Stars wasn’t on Tangiblee’s initial radar, but a friend introduced them to it and they decided to just go for it. They did all their applications and interviews remotely from Israel via Google Hangouts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most of the big things that happen to you in your life &#8211; you don’t plan them. I didn’t think it was going to be this fast. It’s been a life changing event. It was a pretty easy decision to come here. It’s an opportunity we couldn’t have gotten in Israel in every aspect &#8211; business development, investor exposure, trying what we do in a big market.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Coming to Techstars was the best decision we made. It has improved us in every parameter of the business.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On choosing a co-founder</strong></span>:<br />
“We’ve known each other for 6-7 years and worked together in the same room at a previous company. We started throwing around ideas and eventually found one we wanted to go for. We’re very different, but complete in terms of things we bring to the table.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Most things you can’t control, but choosing a co-founder is the thing you can control. If you choose right or wrong &#8211; it will have a lot of impact on the business. So luckily, we both chose right.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> On getting the first investors and customers</strong></span>:<br />
For Tangiblee, it has been about getting your network to take a bet and keeping them happy about the bet they are taking.</p>
<p>“We learned that network is super important. The way you present your business is so important. It’s not just about presenting it to the outside, it affects how you think about business internally.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t imagine the fundraising would go as it did. It was very quick thanks to the tons of lessons we learned about presenting our company, showing what’s important and focusing on the right stuff to progress.  When we went to investors at the end of the summer they saw serious progress. They are betting on something that has a good chance.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It (getting customers) was a combination of luck, network and people who just loved our product. Your first customers don’t know if it’s going to work, but they really like what your product is representing. You need someone to take a bet, and after they take the bet you need them to be happy about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On advice</strong></span>:<br />
Eliad is careful and humble to say that he’s not qualified to give advice necessarily, but he is working on and believes in the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Take things in proportion. That’s something I still need to work on. Another thing you learn is just to get used to getting out of your comfort zone on a daily basis, even an hourly basis. If you don’t do that you’re not going to enjoy the ride and you have to enjoy the ride. Most of it is the ride &#8211; I don’t know how the ride will end. You have to enjoy the ride because it is one hell of a ride.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At the time of the interview, Tangiblee had just closed its first round of funding and was buckling down for their first winter in Chicago. “I hadn’t been to Chicago before, but I really like it. It’s exactly what I want. Everyone is trying to scare me about winter, but I’m not worried.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Hillary Sawchuk<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: An online publication that sits down with the most interesting and influential celebrities, artists, athletes and industry leaders one drink at a time.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://adrinkwith.com/" target="_blank">http://adrinkwith.com/</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adrinkwith" target="_blank">Twitter</a>; <a href="https://instagram.com/adrinkwith/" target="_blank">Instagram</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: March 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_630" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sawchuk-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-630" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sawchuk-2-300x300.jpg" alt="Hillary Sawchuk, A Drink With" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hillary Sawchuk, <a href="http://adrinkwith.com/">A Drink With</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Hillary Sawchuk is the founder and CEO of A Drink With, an online publication that sits down with the most interesting and influential celebrities, artists, athletes and industry leaders one drink at a time. To date, she’s interviewed over 200 individuals including celebrities such as John Legend, Common, Aaron Paul and Daymond John; and has worked with creative partners like Jim Beam, Acura, and most recently, Virgin Hotels. She is building her internet publication one reader at a time, one interview at a time and one drink at a time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On starting out</strong></span>:<br />
If you check out the site now, you’ll see a sleek, light, modern web page. &#8220;We really want our readers to feel like a fly on the wall, and as part of the conversation. We’re really into the photography and we want it to look artsy and feel like a nice magazine.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“At the beginning, I didn’t know how to buy a domain name; I didn’t know what Tumblr was; I didn’t know what WordPress was. Thank goodness I had a friend, Anthony, who told me I could create a blog for free on WordPress! Then, the spare $250 I had went towards a logo and that just seemed like so much money at the time. Thank goodness for WordPress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the site has gone through two major redesigns and Hillary is already visualizing the site’s next face lift. “It’s always a work in progress.” She reminisces jokingly about how at the beginning, before she learned more about web design, she told her web designer that she wanted to use Beyonce’s website as a model &#8211; turns out Beyonce’s web design budget is pretty big… but it’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On making it a business</strong></span>:<br />
Since the inception, Hillary knew she wanted to turn A Drink With into a business. Originally, they conceptualized a more traditional ad model to make revenue. Luckily, after watching an episode of Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee​, she was inspired when she noticed that Accura was the sponsor of the series episode.“We definitely didn’t even realize that was a thing!” As a result,[because Acura is a sponsor of the Sundance Film Festival] they reached out to Acura and pitched an <a href="http://adrinkwith.com/acura/" target="_blank">interview series</a> featuring the Sundance Film Festival&#8217;s actors, directors and producers in attendance.</p>
<p>With every sponsorship that Hillary lands for A Drink With, she gets to work with the sponsoring brand’s creative team and create custom content for their brand, with no traditional web ads. In 2015, A Drink With will be doing one interview a month at Chicago’s Virgin Hotel which you can see on the A Drink With site or on the <a href="http://virginhotels.com/step-inside/" target="_blank">Virgin Hotel Blog.</a> “It’s really fun to collaborate with brands that align with what we’re doing.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On what it is really about</strong></span>:<br />
Hillary has the opportunity to interview influential celebrities at the international, national, and local level. Her dream is “to have a presence in every city, and to get to know the up and coming talent and people behind your favorite bars and restaurants.” Even with growing access to big-time celebrities, Hillary always wants to make room to feature the people behind local brands in a city.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That’s how we started here in Chicago. There are so many inspiring stories out there that aren’t just from celebrities. Don’t get me wrong &#8211; I still think it’s awesome to talk to celebrities, but no one is off limits. If someone has a great story that someone else can take something from, and learn something from, that encourages them to follow their own dream &#8211; that’s what we’re really all about.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Looking back, Hillary believes that &#8220;everything happens for a reason. I feel like I had to go through some of the lessons I’ve learned along the way so that I can apply them the rest of my life.&#8221; Look for Hillary having drinks with all the cool kids at the Virgin Hotel Chicago.</p>

<p>Eliad Inbar is the co-founder of Tangiblee. He came to Chicago last summer after Tangiblee was accepted to the 2014 class of Tech Stars. Eliad believes he is a lucky guy in life and that people can affect their luck by being open to and seizing opportunities &#8211; such as Tangiblee.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Steven Dyme and Joseph Dickstein<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: On demand, socially conscious, artisan flower service<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/" target="_blank">https://www.flowersfordreams.<wbr />com/</a>; <a href="https://instagram.com/flowersfordreams/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/flowers4dreams" target="_blank">Twitter</a>; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/flowersfordreams" target="_blank">Facebook</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: February 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_528" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dyme.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dyme-300x300.jpg" alt="Steven Dyme, Flowers for Dreams" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steven Dyme, <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/">Flower for Dreams</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.thedodus.com/&quot;">Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p>Steven Dyme is the CEO and Co-founder of Flowers for Dreams. Its aesthetic is quite dreamy, and they actually contribute to dreams by donating a portion of each bouquet’s proceeds to a local charity. Steven&#8217;s favorite flower changes with the season (as do their bouquets). At the time of the interview, it was poppies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On &#8211; why flowers?</strong></span><br />
Steven is very transparent that the reason for getting into flowers has nothing to do with a love or passion for flowers. He’s not an artist turned businessman; he is a businessman turned flower expert.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As college students, he and his buddies had a side business called “Lakeshore Roses” where they would peddle flowers at local commencement ceremonies. “I don’t know if I would even call that a business. It was more a legion of college buddies trying to make a lot of money. We didn’t really know what we were doing, but from all that came this interesting idea.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">They began partnering directly with schools to sell flowers inside commencement ceremonies (instead of just standing outside); and to attract the business of the schools and customers, they donated a backpack of school supplies for each bouquet sold.</p>
<p>From doing that, they realized they’d stumbled across a market that was under served in many areas. They learned that there were no good flower options at low price points. If you wanted to pay less, you got crap; and if you wanted something nice, you had very limited expensive options that rarely delivered outside their neighborhoods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“We just wanted a better way. Maybe we were a little fool hardy thinking that we could provide the better way &#8211; but in reality we could. We were buying our products for commencement events from the same places that local florists were buying their flowers. They don’t have to be so absurdly marked up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On improving industry processes to change the game</strong></span>:<br />
Flowers for Dreams starts all their bouquets at $35/bouquet and offers free delivery within Chicago. How can they accomplish all that? The goal of Flowers for Dreams was always to “provide great flowers at a reasonable price point”. To do so, the team realized they needed to focus on 1) eliminating waste and 2) controlling the process and margins.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Part of our value proposition is that we control the whole process and own the whole margin. We curate the products in house, we design in house and we almost entirely deliver in house. That is very intentional. It’s rare in the floral industry for a florist to control more than 2 parts of that process. Usually, if anything, they only control the acquisition of orders and none of the process.”</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Apparently, in 2011, the Society for American Florists reported that the average spoilage rate for florists was a whopping 37%. “That’s the cost of doing business. 1 out of every 3 stems is dying before sale!” Steven reports that Flowers for Dreams spoilage rate is closer to 4-5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To reduce the average industry waste, Flowers for Dreams does a lot of complicated things, but 2 conceptually simple things. 1) They buy from local markets every day and offer an essentially “just-in-time” service 2) They limit the inventory required by offering fewer options &#8211; a menu of 6-8 bouquets that have specific designs, but not necessarily specific flowers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We don’t have to make the <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/flowers/love" target="_blank">love bouquet</a> with roses. We mimic the design that someone pays for. We use the freshest available and effectively priced flowers in the market that day to sell at that price.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building brand loyalty</strong></span>:<br />
Steven feels that one of the big misses in the floral industry is the lack of branding. “1-800-Flowers is the opposite of brand loyalty. No one wants their bouquet to say ‘1-800-Flowers’. Local high-end florists elicit customer loyalty, but their reach is limited.”<br />
Through growing Flowers for Dreams, Steven has become obsessed with the visual design of their brand, as is evident by their products and marketing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are very careful about the discovery process and the branding. Our burlap sack packaging makes our bouquets easily identifiable out in the wild.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On having a social conscience</span></strong>:<br />
The team recognized that no one was giving for giving in the industry. Integrating social consciousness didn’t really exist in the floral industry when they introduced it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Doing good is really good business. That’s how we first incorporated it. That’s the honest truth. It’s difficult to do something that is purely altruistic and selfless &#8211; but you start to feel really good and it’s become such a huge part of our identity and motivation. It helps me wake up every morning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Each month Flowers for Dream partners with a local charity, and with each new partnership they are making a higher dollar impact than the month before.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On confidence</strong></span>:<br />
As a young entrepreneur, Steven has learned that you shouldn’t be afraid.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid of anyone or anything. Dont’ be intimidated. You can’t enter a conversation thinking that the person opposite you is smarter. You’re losing out of the gate if you come in whimpering. It sounds easy, but it’s actually hard. Your outcome will be more desirable by being humble and by believing in yourself and talking like an equal. Don’t be a wimp.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t be intimidated by what you think is difficult or who you think is too tough or too smart for you. Have confidence in your ability to solve a problem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">Flowers for Dreams is currently working on expansion, a new round of funding and delivering bouquets all over the city. If you’re buying flowers for your mother, Steven recommends their newly released <a href="https://www.flowersfordreams.com/flowers">Spring bouquet</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Deepak Goel<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Karma Circles is an online peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform.<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: <a href="http://www.karmacircles.com/">http://www.karmacircles.com/</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: January 2015</p>
<p><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DeepakGoel.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-497 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DeepakGoel-241x300.jpg" alt="Deepak Goel, KarmaCircles" width="241" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Deepak Goel, <a href="http://www.karmacircles.com/">KarmaCircles</a><br />
Art by <a href="http://chachi54.deviantart.com/"> Charles McNally</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.karmacircles.com/profile/105/Deepak-Goel">Deepak Goel</a> is the founder of KarmaCircles, an online peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform. He believes in creating bite-sized opportunities for “structured giving” and contributing to the pay-it-forward movement by putting good karma out in the world.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On his product development background and influences</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak is originally from India, but came to Silicon Valley to work for Microsoft after he finished college. There, he “grew up next door” next to all the startup legends under the influence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank">Steve Blank</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries">Eric Ries</a>. He continued to Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley and worked as an early Product Manager at <a href="http://www.coupons.com/">Coupons.com</a> during a period of 6X growth. He returned to India for a while to grow a real estate company, <a href="http://www.indiahomes.com/">IndiaHomes</a> and then returned to the US to be a co-founder at <a href="http://www.packbackbooks.com/">Packback</a>, which brought him here to Chicago.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the idea and inspiration</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak plays the role of mentor, adviser and investor to multiple startups. He advises through organizations such as <a href="http://500.co/">500 Startups</a> and <a href="http://theimpactengine.com/">Impact Engine</a>, and is an angel investor himself; but he spends a great deal of his time mentoring and advising for free. It’s actually all this pro bono advice that gave him the inspiration for KarmaCircles.</p>
<p>“I was giving, giving and giving &#8211; but I wasn’t documenting any of those conversations. I do it because I love doing it, not because I want something in return. But wouldn’t it be great if this could be documented? Giving and receiving is a big part of our life. Why don’t I create a platform where anybody in the world can give and receive for free? It doesn’t matter where you are.”</p>
<p>When someone gives their time within the KarmaCircles community, it is documented by a KarmaNote, which is essentially an online thank you note for what the person did. These notes can then be used to track results of good Karma, create lists of people you’ve helped and taken help from, and build an online profile of yourself through all of the good Karma you are putting back into the world. “It’s like a Twitter of thank you notes.” (<a href="http://www.karmacircles.com/profile/105/Deepak-Goel">You can see Deepak&#8217;s KarmaCircles profile here</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“Uber said every car in this world can be a taxi. I’m saying everyone in this world can be a mentor. We believe that everybody can be an expert to at least a few other people in this world.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On product development and iteration</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak went back to India to put his full-time energy into building and launching the KarmaCircles product in 5 months. He used his experience and education in product management to get things moving. He first shared the concept in a series of 1:1 meetings with about 70 people to refine the idea and concept. Then, he did a mock-up of a visual design and went through another set of 1:1 interviews. After that, he built and launched the product and continues to do 2-4 interviews and interactions daily to spread the word and get feedback and ideas on how the product resonates with people.</p>
<p>True to lean startup methodology, Deepak makes a strong effort to focus on quick iteration and learning versus getting ahead of himself. He believes in evolving slowly, but learning and iterating quickly. Next in line is a formalized marketing campaign outside of word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On investing in startups</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak is an angel investor in a couple of startups himself. He makes it a point to advise the startup founders for several months before making any investment decisions so that he can really understand the strengths of the founders and the business.</p>
<p>“What’s important is that they listen and then they say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They either accept my advice, or they say they’re not accepting it for a reason. If they listen to me all the time then I won’t trust them either.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On Chicago</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak came to Chicago to join the leadership team at Packback before starting KarmaCircles.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I really really love Chicago. What I really loved about Chicago was that people are very friendly. Anyone I asked for a meeting would give me time. People actually told me how grateful they were for my help with Packback. They would say, ‘Thank you so much for helping build up a Chicago company.’ They are patriotic (about Chicago) &#8211; they love each other, they help each other. It’s a friendly environment. I am very optimistic about the Chicago economy growing.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the balance of giving in the world</span></strong>:<br />
Deepak believes that the world can achieve balance through giving and that giving can have viral-level effects if people will just stop burying themselves in their daily lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the things I want to accomplish through KarmaCircles is structured giving. My mom says that everyone in this world should be contributing at least 1% of their time and money for the social good. People have not done that for many centuries. Once everyone starts to devote 1% of their time to the social good, then you don’t need social entrepreneurs to devote 100% of their time to it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>With platforms such as KarmaCircles, Deepak hopes that people can easily give more frequently, in varying amounts and in varying capacities. “Giving will come back to you in ways that you cannot imagine. A company came out of all this giving!”</p>
<hr />
<p>KarmaCicles is also being used by business schools and companies to foster and promote mentoring programs. You can contribute to the KarmaCircles community by signing up at karmacircles.com.  How can you help with 1% of YOUR time?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Aaron Frazin<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Application that researches the people you are scheduled to meet with and sends you insight briefings before your meeting<br />
<strong>Company Site</strong>: https://charlieapp.com; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecharlieapp">Facebook</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/AppCharlie">Twitter</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: January 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_472" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aaronbowtiecrop2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-472" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aaronbowtiecrop2-300x300.jpg" alt="Aaron Frazin, Charlie App" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aaron Frazin, <a href="https://charlieapp.com">Charlie App</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.guru.com/freelancers/ryan-lunde/portfolio">Ryan Lunde</a></p></div>
<p>Aaron Frazin is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://charlieapp.com/">Charlie App</a>, an online application that compiles research and sends you a summary of what you need to nail your next meeting. He dropped out of his senior year of college to accept an invitation to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kauffman.org%2F&amp;ei=MRu8VIrkOIicygTUjYHYBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2zAdePaHkIa8vBOP9rHpRFxRiaQ&amp;sig2=r_REkAs2wJ3c2DGYMnjlPw&amp;bvm=bv.83829542,d.aWw">Kauffman Foundation</a> in pursuit of Charlie App and has not looked back. He aims to become a ‘cool grandpa’ one day who has 1) Changed and innovated something(s) in the world. 2) Lived a life with stories worth repeating. 3) Spread happiness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On being a natural entrepreneur</span></strong>:<br />
Aaron says he didn’t always identify with the terms “founder” or “entrepreneur” necessarily, but he just acted like one from a young age.</p>
<p>“I just always was. When I was 11 I started animating. I asked my parents for some animation and flash software. Don’t know why.” He began finding clients online shortly afterwards. “When I was 13, I told everyone that I was 18 and I would never meet anyone in person and would only meet them over AOL Messenger. Every year I told people I was 18 and no one ever figured it out.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the idea and getting started</span></strong>:<br />
It was the same type of hustle he had as a kid that got Charlie off the ground when he was in college. He came up with the idea after spending a lot of time interviewing companies and recruiters for a job fair. To see if it was an idea worth pursuing, he and his friends offered 3 free briefings from the product (that they had not built) to 30 different executives and sales professionals. For a few weeks, Aaron and his friends stayed up late manually researching and compiling summaries.</p>
<p>“At the time I thought it was so dumb. I’m supposed to create a company and I’m just doing research every day on other peoples’ meetings! Looking back on it, it was one of the most important things we ever did. We were able to get people to say they wanted to pay for it – we learned what people are willing to pay for, what they won’t pay for, and why.”</p>
<p>They used the research and information to prioritize and focus on where to start building first.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On using what you have going for you</span></strong>:<br />
“Some people might be rich so they can fund their startup – so use that.  Some people might already have a ton of connections – so use that. Some people can animate – so use that. Some people are amazing at sales – so use that. For me, one of the things I have going for me is that I’m young. So I’m going to use it.”</p>
<p>“Everyone wants to help the 20-something year old entrepreneur who is just trying to figure things out. I actually e-mailed people who had been CEOs of much bigger companies, and in the subject line said ‘Advice for a young entrepreneur’. People wanted to respond because they felt like they’d been in my shoes before. That’s how I was able to meet a ton of people.” (Aaron writes about asking for help in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-frazin/the-science-behind-gettin_b_2119265.html">Huffington Post</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“There isn’t one recipe for success. Everything everyone tells you and everything you read is just a data point. Use what works for you. So many companies have been created in so many different ways. Determine what you think is best for you and go for it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On focusing on what counts</span></strong>:<br />
An exciting moment for the Charlie App team came when they were featured in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2F2013%2F03%2F09%2Fcharlie-app%2F&amp;ei=siC8VOSOGYKQyATDl4HwCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdCF5p0mAf_J7fBB-Z-nTAzylQeA&amp;sig2=DgZJvLzWUfYd-t9s1OZM8Q&amp;bvm=bv.83829542,d.aWw">Mashable</a> after being selected as a <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/startupvillage/accelerator">SXSW Accelerator</a> Finalist.</p>
<p>“We thought – ‘We are amazing!’ But, one of our advisers told us that it didn’t matter and press doesn’t matter. ‘Your users matter and your key metrics matter and those are the only things that matter. Take a minute and enjoy that, but remember the things that matter.’”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Anytime something like that happens we celebrate for a minute, but we know what the important things that matter are, and that we have to focus on those. Image is not success. It’s about how well you’re solving the problem of your users.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On building a team</span>:</strong><br />
At the time of the interview, there were 9 people on the Charlie App team. They recently started the interview process to add a new engineer to the team. They started with about 100 candidates, and continued interviewing for 8 months before finally making a hire they felt was right.</p>
<p>“Don’t settle. You cannot. When your startup is this early, every single person is a leader and will be the leadership team for years to come. It has to be someone we love to be around, someone who is super smart- smarter than us. It’s very important to us to keep our team like a family because we have a chance to make it right and build a foundation.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On funding:</span></strong><br />
To date, Charlie App has raised $1.75M.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Funding follows success, success does not follow funding. Remember what’s important and when you’re achieving that, then investors will come to you. In movies it’s all about the pitch and persuasion. But investors are smart and they’re going to get down to what the most important things are to your business. And if those things are truly going well, then you’ll see funding.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On momentum</span>:</strong><br />
“It’s all hustle in the beginning. After that the only thing I found to be true is momentum. As you have more and more momentum things get easier. Nothing you read will help you except hustle and finding out what resonates with the people you’re targeting. You’re going to fail 1000 times, but eventually you’ll get your first employee, and raise your first round.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not about taking short cuts &#8211; it’s just going to be hard. But you can power through it, even if most people won’t.  If you decide to keep powering through it, then know that it’s hard and know that it gets easier and easier with momentum. Your goal is to solve the problem and keep creating momentum.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You can find the Charlie App team going to concerts together and throwing dinner parties to foster collaboration in the startup community. They continue to focus on their customer needs and key metrics while hustling to keep the momentum going. “I sleep thinking about it, I wake up thinking about it. I just want to solve the problems.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Co-founder and CEO</strong>: Ben Rosenfield<br />
<strong>Company description</strong>: App that makes it easier for freelancers and potential clients to connect. Anyone can make money with their skills on the side.<br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: July 2016</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAALaAAAAJDM4OGM3NmI3LTUyNjktNDIyNy05MjI2LWNmYWM3NzdlNDliYg.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></p>
<p>Ben Rosenfield is an entrepreneur, a traveler, and an accidental reality star. He began his entrepreneurship journey about ten years ago in commercial real estate with <a href="http://www.titancommercial.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.titancommercial.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576333000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiO8bvDbEmfgp41V1omvw-LxAeAg">Titan Commercial</a>, expanded into the technology and marketing sector with <a href="https://freebieapp.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://freebieapp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576333000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGti0mfCNEgX_WR6efBWKWMZszS-g">Freebie</a>, and is now getting ready to launch his latest venture, Hero &#8211; a streamlined marketplace that  connects skilled freelancers, or ‘heros’, with clients.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From estate to technology</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ben has always used his background in psychology and consumer behavior to his advantage. He started his first commercial real estate company when he was 25, and focused on location strategy to expand and attract clients.</p>
<p>“I loved making deals and working in commercial real estate, but I really didn’t think I was doing anything that could change the world and really mean something.”</p>
<p>After about four years in real estate,  he began working with a friend on a technology business and was intrigued by how technology could help businesses directly connect to consumers in a totally different way.  That interest led him to found his first technology company, <a href="https://freebieapp.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://freebieapp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvEa0KgTLcCYkwxR77Pd9GpsQv8g">Freebie</a>, a mobile app that connects social media influencers to brands in exchange for free product. It allows the brand to quantify the ROI on social media investment and effectively build it into their marketing strategies.</p>
<p>With solid technology experience under his belt, Ben was ready for a new idea that was ‘closer to (his) heart’ &#8212; which brought him to Hero.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What’s a Hero?</span>:</strong></p>
<p>“The whole idea behind Hero is that anyone with a skill can make money on the side. We need a faster way to find that instead of spamming our Facebook friends or Googling people we don’t know. Hero is a platform that allows anyone with a skill to make money on the side wherever you are in this world. If you’re a trainer or a masseuse or a social media expert or a camera man &#8212; you have the ability to connect to jobs 24/7. You can market your skills anytime you want. It’s kind of like Airbnb but for your own service.”</p>
<p>Ben points out that there are a wealth of individuals out there with skills that can be exchanged for money, but they don’t know how to make the connections.</p>
<p>“Right now people are driving Uber as a lifestyle. These are college grads and highly trained people. I actually just got off the phone with an Olympic athlete who is driving Uber. On Hero, he could monetize his skill and train people instead of being crouched down in a car.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Hero epitomizes my lifestyle. It allows me and anyone else to monetize their skill sets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Making it easy:</strong></span></p>
<p>Freelancing and side hustles aren’t new, but the ease and reliability of connecting clients and service providers online is evolving.</p>
<p>“What’s holding people back is a technology solution. People don’t want to go on <a href="https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoxbklMJd_A6TZH0_g6ZGQpur6Kw">Elance</a> or <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.thumbtack.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF9OB0cLYO6A5CQ2YMi1DE1Fz0J5Q">Thumbtack</a> because of the amount of paperwork it takes to get onto it. The general population tries to take the simplest route possible. With Hero, the on-boarding and application process takes less than three minutes. Then, you get a follow-up phone call to verify who you are, what you do, and provide some references.”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like the difference between <a href="http://www.eharmony.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.eharmony.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFebEwAKnJtoOnCScjXYQmuHEq0sA">eHarmony</a> and <a href="http://www.match.com/cpx/en-us/match/IndexPage/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.match.com/cpx/en-us/match/IndexPage/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNB0wOKsn_y9WCOee92hsLRaGzAQ">Match.com</a> versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder_(app)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder_(app)&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGw17Yt3t47HpxPU-GiJQdgl65IOA">Tinder</a> and <a href="https://bumble.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://bumble.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBkbPxkhu9Qg_gILa9Yghgvu6yYQ">Bumble</a>. There are a lot of people who are online dating that never went on Match.com because the process of signing up and creating an account was too much.”</p>
<p>In addition to the ease of on-boarding, the cost to market yourself and search for services is free. Hero’s business model is to act as a payment processor between Heroes and clients to simplify and ensure reliable payment. The more you use the Hero payment processor, the more leads and reviews you get to build your Hero network and testimonials.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where to become a hero</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Hero will be launching first in Los Angeles and Chicago.  Los Angeles due to the massive freelancing economy there, and Chicago because that’s where Ben’s roots are.</p>
<p>“LA is the biggest and best freelancing economy in the country. Everybody there is an actor and a graphic designer; a trainer and a waiter. Everyone has a side hustle, with multiple jobs and multiple income streams.”</p>
<p>Ben actually got a first row seat to the LA freelancing community when he had the unique opportunity to be on the Mark Burnet reality show, <a href="http://www.fox.com/coupled" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.fox.com/coupled&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473724576334000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGsQtBwi2B_tsQF05FRPWSct_5xw">Coupled</a>.</p>
<p>“The entertainment industry is built on the back of freelancers. Everyday a producer or production company can lose crew members, and it’s like a forest fire to find a replacement. With Hero, what used to take days can now take moments. We’re able to allow producers to find people and solve this problem more efficiently than before. Additionally, we allow crew members to find jobs more regularly.”</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking back on his experience over the last ten years, what would Ben have done differently? &#8211; “Invest in Google.” Fast forwarding to today, what is he doing better now than in his early entrepreneurial days? &#8211; “Focus.”</p>
<p>Watch for your opportunity to use your skills to become a Hero, and catch Ben on the Fox’s Coupled on Tuesdays at 8 pm Central.</p>

<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ted-Gonder-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-751 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ted-Gonder-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Ted Gonder, Moneythink" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ted Gonder, <a href="http://moneythink.org/">Moneythink</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://thedodus.com/"> Brad Lacke</a></p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Ted Gonder is a social entrepreneur, a mentor, an optimist for change, and the founder of <a href="http://moneythink.org/">Moneythink</a> &#8211; an organization that is restoring the economic health of the United States through preventative, transformative, and evidence-driven youth financial education. Moneythink is headquartered in Chicago because “if you’re going to solve an education problem anywhere in the US, Chicago is the place to do it.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the power of mentorship</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When I was 14, I had a math tutor who really helped set me straight and aspire to greater heights. From him and other mentors, I learned to think about my life like an entrepreneurial venture and my decisions like each was an investment in my future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a mentor has been a core part of who I am because I think the way to pay it forward is to do for others for what was done for you.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On blending approaches and tactics to bring change</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted believes that Moneythink’s approach is unique because it is taking the best of various methods to build a more complete and impactful financial literacy approach that has never existed before.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Moneythink is tackling the issue of youth financial capability unlike anybody else. Financial education is nearly a billion dollar industry, but the industry as a whole has very little to show for it. What we’ve done is premise our entire approach on high-touch, high-tech, blended-learning interventions. We are taking the age-old proven method of mentorship to transform youth trajectories, and infusing it with cutting edge technology to get better data, to reach students outside of the classroom, and to deepen the relationship between the mentor and pupil. Nobody else is doing that.  Everyone is either doing volunteer programs or relying entirely on technology as a way to reach students. No one else is saying that maybe the right solution is blending the old and the new.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Financial education is nearly a billion dollar industry, but the industry as a whole has very little to show for it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Most people say that education technology helps you reach more kids. We know many of our kids are not self-directed learners yet. Rather than just expecting them to engage with an app, we weave technology into an existing mentor program.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building financial literacy into education curriculum</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted sat on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/26/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans</a> where he had a front row seat into the federal discussion, and an opportunity to represent the needs of younger generations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The unfortunate reality is that financial capability is not viewed as a critical component of a young person’s education in terms of what makes our nation more competitive. This is partially because financial literacy programs to date have been too fragmented in their approach so there is not substantive data that says financial skill-building interventions have hard economic implications on a student’s upward mobility, debt levels, and anything else that a government ultimately cares about. When you try to make the education argument for financial literacy you’re competing with math and science standards, and without adequate proof it&#8217;s hard to justify even slight reductions in time spent on those standards. That’s another reason that we see our role as so completely necessary &#8211; this industry needs some serious upending.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;This industry needs some serious upending.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">On the topic of actually making financial literacy more engaging to youth, Ted says that the program tries to weave otherwise boring financial topics into examples that youth can relate to, such as celebrities. For example, talking about Wesley Snipes evading taxes or the Kardashians&#8217; credit card habits. “It completely changed the student experience. If you meet people where they are and then bring finance into something that relates to what they&#8217;re interested in,  and the way they think and perceive the world; then you can make a big impact into somebody’s thinking.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On winning the White House Champions of Change award and social media</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2012, Moneythink was called by the White House as one of the finalists for the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/champions" target="_blank">White House Champions of Change</a>. “That was the moment where it really become clear that this was a national movement.”</p>
<p>In order to win, the Moneythink team had one week to get the most votes. “If you study people who have successfully built loyal online followings, they say social media is just a tool but what really matters are the relationships you build to help you get your message out. What helped us win the White House competition and rally so many votes wasn&#8217;t that we had a ton of Facebook likes or Twitter followers to begin with, but that we had built a massive allegiance of enthusiastic, college-aged, hyper-connected leaders and we leaned on all of them to drive traffic to this voting page. We’d built a network and kept them updated personally &#8211; not just through social media. That’s what gave us something to tap into that was real. I think it’s easy to mistake social media for something that is inherently substantive, but it’s not. The relationships that you build in real life matter so much more.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it’s easy to mistake social media for something that is inherently substantive, but it’s not. The relationships that you build in real life matter so much more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On measuring change</strong></span>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our three core metrics are: 1) Are our students saving more regularly? 2) Are our students spending more mindfully? 3) Are our students making wiser safer financial product choices as they enter adulthood?&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are in the midst of a three year longitudinal study funded by <a href="http://www.spentmovie.com/mobilizing-clarksdale.html">American Express</a> in Clarksdale, Mississippi. We are tracking 11th and 12th graders through the program and after the program ends. The first year’s results were just released and are very encouraging. We hope that we can begin creating benchmarks that we can hold the rest of the industry to.”</p>
<hr />
<p dir="ltr">To condense it all into one Tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/tedgonder" target="_blank">@tedgonder</a> offers, “Dream big. Start small. Save today. Spend mindfully. Watch where you step. Most of all, find a mentor and stick to your guns.” You can read more on Ted’s philosophies on <a href="http://www.tedgonder.com/#blog" target="_blank">his blog</a>.</p>

<strong>Company Description</strong>: Membership organization that connects and helps business and technology women entrepreneurs<br />
<strong>Company Website</strong>: <a href="http://ms-tech.co/" target="_blank">http://ms-tech.co/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/MsTechGroup" target="_blank">@MsTechGroup</a>; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MsTechGroup?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview</strong>: July 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_745" style="width: 267px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ms-Tech-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-745 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ms-Tech-1-257x300.jpg" alt="Nicole Yeary, Ms. Tech" width="257" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nicole Yeary, <a href="https://ms-tech.co/">Ms. Tech</a><br /> Art by <a href=" http://tiffaniemang.squarespace.com/">Tiffanie Mang</a></p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole Yeary is the founder of Ms. Tech, a membership organization that helps business and technology women entrepreneurs collaborate, network and ultimately invest in each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On learning the ropes</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole spent many successful years working in health insurance business development and sales. In 2008, she decided to pursue her own healthcare startup, and even with her years of industry expertise and knowledge, she found herself faced with a whole new world of challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“The startup world was so different than any business world I’d ever known.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To tackle the learning curve, she ended up taking a job with a newly funded startup as their first official full-time hire. She asked questions; she attended pitch events; she took additional gigs. This all pre-dated the current startup scene in Chicago &#8211;  pre 1871, Starter League, Startup Weekend, and BuiltIn Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On switching pursuits to Ms. Tech</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Following her natural spirit of collaboration, Nicole attended and formed informal communities through brunches (#shygirlbrunch) and created a Facebook group to bring business and technology-focused women together for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“I wanted to make something that we could share and take going to lunch or brunch together to another level. I wanted to see us all get something out of it.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“How can we do business together? How can we transfer the wealth among us, and how can we invest in each other?”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the Facebook group, she realized that “the knowledge share was huge. People fed off of that. They got excited. There were a ton of smart women sharing what they knew and together we created a community that provided networking along with an added layer of well curated mind-sharing. That became an incredible resource, an instant perceived value to our Ms.Tech tribe and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In January 2014, Ms. Tech became an official entity and added a First Class Membership option. Today, they have about 100 members.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On examining the issues</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">“Only 2.7% of venture-backed startups are female founded &#8212; that&#8217;s not the problem. That&#8217;s the issue caused by a deeper rooted problem. To really uncover the root cause of this issue has been a journey. We started by asking questions: How many women need startup capital? How many women are pitching VCs? How much are they asking for? Do they know how to navigate the due diligence process? These are all questions we are working on so that we can develop impact measurement; develop the most viable solution that will create the greatest impact; and truly leverage greater economic empowerment for all women.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole wants to  focus her time on identifying sources of the actual problem. &#8220;Our First Class membership has taken us from a Facebook group to an organization that is serious about working on a solution by taking assumptions and putting them through the same lean methodology to test our hypothesis. That makes us incredibly grateful for every partner and First Class member.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On unifying as a community to succeed</strong></span>:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Nicole believes that at every level, banding together is more powerful than operating apart. “The conversation is split among women as well. Not everyone has the same networks and the same accessibility.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">“We are challenged together. We are investing in each other and changing the status quo so anyone can disrupt industries. I would like to see women I know continue to lift each other up, take a vested interest in each other&#8217;s work, and do business with one another.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Even in Chicago there is some traditional segregation between neighborhoods and communities. I continue to work toward a ‘Team Chicago’ mentality, a message of pride in what the people in our city are doing.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Profile</strong>: Elizabeth Peterson, Eastwood Group<br />
<strong>Company Description</strong>: Payment integration consulting and FinTech software product development<br />
<strong>Website</strong>: <a href="http://www.elizabetheastwood.com/" target="_blank">http://www.elizabetheastwood.<wbr />com/</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/chitownlizzy" target="_blank">@Chitownlizzy</a><br />
<strong>Date of interview</strong>: October 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_739" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson.png"><img class="wp-image-739 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ekizabeth-peterson-300x293.png" alt="Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group" width="300" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Petersen, Eastwood Group <br /> Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco Dibattista</a></p></div>
<p>Elizabeth Peterson is an artist, an entrepreneur, a mother, a seeker of truth and continuous improvement. She started her education in arts and fashion, but ended up with a career in financial technology; and is in the process of creating payment software to change the pace of payment on-boarding and integration.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On how she got from art to finance to startups</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth actually went to school for fine arts, came to Chicago to be in fashion design, and quickly discovered that she wasn’t interested in staying in the fashion industry. She changed her trajectory and ended up with a 10 year long career in financial technology services, which developed her expertise in payment integration infrastructure and implementations for large clients.</p>
<p>“I’m a terrible employee though. I like to find loopholes and skip over everything. I never stop at my job title. I always want to boil the ocean and am looking for what’s next all the time. I’m not an office person. I can’t draw in the lines and follow all the rules.”</p>
<p>Though she generally only consulted for larger companies, her client portfolio brought her in contact with a few earlier stage companies that needed her services.</p>
<p>“I was instructed to help out these much larger companies, and had very high revenue targets. But my gut was telling me that it was really these guys (early stage companies) that needed my help. This was the energy that I wanted to be a part of, so I had to put myself there.”</p>
<p>After being introduced to the <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a> community, she had the opportunity to do payment integration consulting for <a href="http://www.rippleshot.com/" target="_blank">Rippleshot</a>, <a href="http://sportslock.com/" target="_blank">Sportslock</a>, and <a href="http://www.getoccasion.com/" target="_blank">Occasion</a>, which gave her confidence to use what she’d learned and validated to begin driving the creation of her own software to better meet clients&#8217; needs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the startup community and scaling</strong></span>:</p>
<p>“I think the startup world in Chicago has a heart of gold. It’s amazing how all of them are connected and partner together on different projects. There’s a different community in startups &#8211; it’s more like family. Everyone wants to help everyone out &#8211; crowd sourcing, camaraderie, transparency.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s specialty is helping startup companies scale their payment technology and infrastructure.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s like watching your kids grow up. You watch these companies go through name changes and team changes &#8211; and now they’re getting millions in funding, and have great success stories. It’s an amazing thing to be a part of, and now it is my turn to be a success story.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On mission, inspiration, and mentorship</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Elizabeth says that she looks for mentors that share her mission, and confesses that connecting with mentors did not come naturally.</p>
<p>“Mentorship was a hard thing to take on for me. I tend to think that I can do everything on my own and wear a million different hats. But you can’t. I’m learning to delegate to people who are better than me and learn from people 10-15 years ahead of me.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth is inspired by the “radical generosity” among women entrepreneurs started by <a href="https://sheeo.world/#home" target="_blank">SheEO</a> founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsaunders" target="_blank">Vicki Saunders</a> and hopes to “be like these people in 10-15 years to be able to help other women.” Who else is she looking ahead to? &#8211; <a href="http://sunnybates.com/" target="_blank">Sunny Bates</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a> to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On finding new focus</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Last year she founded The Eastwood Group, a FinTech company with the mission of developing new technology to impact the payments industry, and made a last minute decision to go through the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Google_Brand_CHI_9B_General-Assembly&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwkeiwBRCzmo-wiKL49pEBEiQAhvGKYasF8Ep5LDQ22YZWdTFrKRe5em2yhN21C9_boLOX1fkaAhEn8P8HAQ" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> UX Design Immersive Program to regain some focus and structure for her product vision.</p>
<p>“I had to make some things happen. If you don’t have a structured process, then you’re lost. I was lost &#8211; all over the place and was working on too many projects. So I decided I needed to learn how to do it the right way.”</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i>It definitely took some risk, but you have to just jump. I would’ve never thought I’d be as far as I am today. Now I have so much more focus and I understand what I need to get done. I know the type of person I need to be and I’m excited for the next 10 years.”</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You can find Elizabeth at <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">, lending her expertise to clients downtown, attending tech events, and speaking on the future of payments.”</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>COO</strong>: Kris Petersen<br />
<strong>Company Description:</strong> Curated clothing service for kids &#8211;  ‘Trunk Club for kids’<br />
<strong>Company Site:</strong> <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">https://www.macandmia.com/</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/macmiastyle" target="_blank">@MacMiaStyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/krispetersen">@KrisPetersen</a><br />
<strong>Date of Interview:</strong> September 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_733" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kris-petersen-1.png"><img class="wp-image-733 size-medium" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kris-petersen-1-300x293.png" alt="Kris Petersen, Mac and Mia" width="300" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kris Petersen, <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/">Mac and Mia</a><br /> Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DeBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Kris Petersen is a serial entrepreneur, founder, and currently the COO of <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a>, a responsibly sourced “<a href="http://trunkclub.com/" target="_blank">Trunk Club</a> for kids.” His favorite place in the world is Door County, Wisconsin and his favorite food is Chicago pizza.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On learning and creativity</strong></span>:<br />
Kris taught himself to code back in middle school, took a class in college, and then really dug into it after hours while he was a consultant for IBM.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For me, learning to code was really an outlet for creativity and building. When I was in corporate America, I always felt something was missing. That’s why I turned to development on nights and weekends &#8211; to fill my creative need to do something. Those activities were never centered around money or building a business.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“People forget they have that ability to learn. In the shuffling of the every day you just think you never have time.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On building his way to Mac and Mia</strong></span>:<br />
After many years of working as a corporate technology consultant and launching web applications on the side, Kris joined the world of venture-funding, entrepreneurship and startups. One of his major development projects, <a href="http://www.neighborhuddle.com/" target="_blank">Neighborhuddle</a>, was a content management system for condo boards. It inspired his first official product, <a href="http://www.dealsgoround.com/" target="_blank">DealsGoRound</a> (later rebranded as myCabbage), a second-hand market for daily deal coupons. DealsGoRound caught the attention of the press and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lefkofsky" target="_blank">Eric Lefkofsky</a>, which led Kris to become an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at <a href="http://www.lightbank.com/" target="_blank">Lightbank</a>.</p>
<p>“With coding came the ability to build different things. My entrance into the venture capital world came by way of the guys at Lightbank finding me doing interesting things in the weeds and introducing me to this world.”</p>
<p>After DealsGoRound was acquired, Kris became the CTO of Betterfly, a video-chat learning platform that was sold to <a href="https://takelessons.com/">TakeLessons</a>. He then became the co-founder of <a href="https://www.eatmorsel.com/" target="_blank">Morsel</a>, and is now the COO of <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a> under founder Marie Tillman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On acquisitions and corporate development</strong></span>:<br />
Kris has raised multiple rounds of funding, gone through two acquisitions and has danced with big companies on corporate development. With Mac and Mia, the business currently only has angel investors and is “very calculated on who we talk to and who can add value to the business.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to acquisitions, there&#8217;s a lot of fishing expeditions going on from larger companies. In the end, there may not be a lot of serious interest. When you get that corporate development e-mail from Google, you feel like ‘Holy cow- I’m going to go buy an island!’ The reality is that it is someone’s job all day long to send out emails like that. At the end of the day they may have no interest other than figuring out what’s happening in the space.You have to be careful because it is incredibly time consuming, and it also mentally rattles you a little bit.”<br />
<span class="im"> </span><br />
“Corporate development can be a total distraction from a startup&#8217;s business. You hope to be in the position of power and I think if you are you’ll know. And if you feel like you’re not, then you’re not.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On ideas versus execution:</strong></span><br />
“It takes a lot of motivation for someone to work on something that’s unproven, that’s hard, that might not make money. The alternative is to flip on Tivo and watch the latest episode of something.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s no shortage of people with ideas. 99.9% of them never take the first step.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On executing with purpose</strong></span>:<br />
With Mac and Mia, Kris has evolved his clarity on executing purposefully and believing in values outside of driving a business. His daily purpose at Mac and Mia is straight-forward &#8211; “Getting boxes out the door and increasing the number of orders”. Along with that, Mac and Mia supports a larger purpose of responsible manufacturing and local business support that Kris can get behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m moving forward a lot more purposefully with what I’m working on right now. My personality is that I just get things done &#8211; but the question is, ‘Are you getting the right things done?’ It is about supporting a single measurable goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“In the past, I was just building things because people thought they were good ideas. With Mac and Mia the big picture felt right to me. I want to work on something I believe in. There’s a massive emphasis on women entrepreneurs, sourcing responsibly, sourcing locally, and responsible manufacturing. Every dollar we spend on inventory is deeply researched. “</p>
<hr />
<p>What get Kris excited? &#8211; “Mac and Mia gets me excited. I genuinely believe Mac and Mia will be a massive company.” Learn more about <a href="https://www.macandmia.com/about/" target="_blank">Mac and Mia</a> and how to add “connection and discovery” to children’s clothing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Founders</strong>: Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Company Description</strong>: Platform of tools to ‘discover your inner awesome.’</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Site</strong>:</span><a href="http://www.idealemon.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.idealemon.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ideaLemon"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://twitter.com/ideaLemon</span></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Interview Date</strong>: August 2015</span></p>
<div id="attachment_723" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/martin-rajiv.png"><img class="wp-image-723 size-large" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/martin-rajiv-1024x516.png" alt="Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan, Idea Lemon" width="610" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Martin McGovern and Rajiv Nathan,<a href="http://www.idealemon.com/"> Idea Lemon</a><br /> Art by Francesco DiBattista</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin and Rajiv are the co-founders of Idea Lemon, a platform of tools to help you ‘discover your inner awesome’. They are optimistic about the lifestyle you are empowered to create by pivoting your inner dialogue, pinpointing your mission and purpose, and turning your ideas into actions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On turning an idea into action</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin and Rajiv were co-founders of the DePaul marketing club in college. After graduation, they both realized how dissatisfying and ineffective the average networking event was and decided to “create our own platform where we can learn what we want to learn and connect with the people we want to connect with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning, they only focused on small ‘knowledge working events’ where they chose a dedicated topic for each event to guide conversation and interactions. They observed how the format successfully guided people to explore themselves and connect with others at a deeper level, which ended up evolving into a study in personal branding. They launched their first personal branding workshop via</span><a href="https://dabble.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dabble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and called it, ‘Discover Your Inner Awesome.’ Since then, they have also launched an Idea Lemon Podcast, been VIPs at <a href="http://techweek.com/">Tech Week</a>, and are launching a new online course soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On personal branding through mission and purpose</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
“It’s really about figuring out the core of what you believe in as a person and using that to structure how you think about yourself, talk about yourself, and the lifestyle you want to live. What is your definition of success? How do you know when you’ve made it? The pursuit of answering those big questions is what leads to the development of everything that we’re doing. We want to help other people answer those questions and use those questions to explore who they are, what their brand is, and figure out what they want to accomplish in their life.” (Martin)</p>
<p>“Everything that you do and care about comes down to two driving forces &#8211; A mission and a purpose. We teach people how to find that, and once you find it you realize that, instead of being a pawn in the chess game, you can become the chess master.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On telling your story</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
Both Martin and Rajiv brand themselves as ‘storytellers’. How does that tie back to helping others find and action what they want?</p>
<p>“Look at everything that people gravitate towards &#8211; it is the story. People want a hero, a villain, and a plot. That’s basically how life is constructed as well. You make yourself out to be the heroes of your own life. There are villains along the way, climaxes, and valleys. We’re telling you to architect your story. You’re playing a character in your own life &#8211; where do you want to take the story?” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“There are two sides of storytelling. There’s the external one you tell other people and there is the internal one you tell yourself. I love the internal story because changing your internal monologue really does change your life. Whatever it is you’re telling yourself that you can’t do &#8211; if you can change that mindset then you can actually change your life and you can bring it to your external voice as well. We try to help people change their inner stories so that when they tell their stories it is actually something they believe, and they are telling an authentic story that connects them to people and opportunities.”(Martin)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On the power of projects</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><br />
One of the tools to achieving your ‘inner awesome’ is to execute projects with intention, purpose, and pride.</p>
<p>“You either need to be totally cool with the life you’re living, or you need to start creating something. Side projects aren’t necessarily about financial needs. It’s about all the intangibles that come with it. It’s the benefit of getting up and going out there and doing something.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“It is defeating that you can’t be confident in the things you enjoy. Usually when you’re talking to someone, the thing that they’re doing 20% of the time is the thing they look forward to doing the most &#8211; so why not get the most out of it? Why not use it to fuel and architect the lifestyle you want or the career you want?” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“Once you switch your mindset from, ‘This is something I do on the side that I can’t talk to you about’, to, ‘This is something that I love, and I want you to know about it, and I want to meet other people who love it,’ then everything changes. You’re no longer someone who is embarrassed about the things you enjoy in your life. It’s sad that at some point in your life you’re taught that you’re not really allowed to enjoy that thing because it’s not your full time job.” (Martin)</p>
<p>“Create the opportunity that you want for yourself. Don’t wait for permission, don’t wait for someone else to hand it to you. Side projects allow you to create your own opportunities. That&#8217;s why we’re launching an online course  &#8211;  to help people launch side projects so they can create and capture that opportunity.” (Rajiv)</p>
<hr />
<p>What mission and purpose does the duo seek for themselves through all this?</p>
<p>“My mission is to shape my life to find the most authentic version of myself in my surroundings. My purpose is to take what I learn and tell stories with it. That’s my way of finding that most authentic version.” (Rajiv)</p>
<p>“My mission and purpose is that I want to understand ideas that are different than my own. The way that I do that is through experimentation and testing. I like to take ideas and turn them into real things for people.” (Martin)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find Martin and Rajiv finishing their epic summer road trip with</span><a href="http://www.under30experiences.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under 30 Experiences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Read and listen to what they’re uncovering and experiencing on their journey via their</span><a href="http://www.idealemon.com/#blog-1-section"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="http://www.idealemon.com/#podcast-section"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

She is part of an all-women trio of co-founders that met and joined forces at the<a href="http://www.starterleague.com/"> Starter League</a> to start<a href="http://www.mrelief.com/"> mRelief</a>, a company whose mission is to “fix the broken American welfare system that leaves vulnerable people without access to available public assistance.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On simplifying the process</span></strong><strong>:</strong><br />
One of the biggest barriers in the welfare application process is how much time it takes. Rose used to carry around the standard food stamps application to help drive this point home to people who had not seen it before &#8211; “It’s 18 pages long.”</p>
<p>mRelief currently focuses on simplifying the qualifying process. They start with a global screening form on the first page of their website that is only 5 questions long, and currently screens for<a href="http://www.mrelief.com/programs"> 8 different programs</a> at once. When mRelief partnered with the King Community Center to pilot their screening process, the results showed that they reduced the assisted application time from an average of 16 minutes to 4 minutes, a 75% decrease. Using this simplified screening process as an entry point, can result in huge time savings for applicants who don’t have that much time. “Almost 3/4 of American who are on a public benefits program are members of working families,” and many of the welfare offices are only open during standard working hours.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On increasing discovery and awareness</span></strong>:<br />
In addition to improving the application process in itself, “mRelief is advancing and increasing transparency, visibility and awareness around the assistance criteria. We’re trying to create awareness about what solves your problem. There may be a local resource, but you just don’t know about it. You might just need food for that week or month, and the<a href="http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/site/PageServer"> Chicago Food Depository</a> has multiple food pantry sites all over the city. If you already know that you’re ineligible for food stamps, finding the closest food pantry might be a better use of your time.” The website offers food pantry referrals through a partnership with <a href="http://purplebinder.com/">Purple Binder</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On extending reach and sustaining impact</span></strong><strong>:</strong><br />
The mRelief screening can be done via the website or text message. “For many low income families there may not be a computer at home, and not everyone has the same literacy to do research on government eligibility. Thinking through how to replicate the paper and web forms via text messaging has benefitted lower income families. People using the text messaging service make an average of $150 less per hour than the people we are reaching online.”</p>
<p>In addition to developing the technology itself, mRelief focuses on building the right partnerships to make an impact within the welfare network. They have integrated with community centers that are run by the<a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss/supp_info/community_servicecenterlocations.html"> Department of Family and Support Services</a>, such as the King, Garfield and North Area community centers in Chicago; and partnered with Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s<a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/#overview"> Innovation Delivery Team</a> to launch the pilot last year.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s not enough to have a one app wonder. You have to build an institution, a network of people who are willing to look ahead at where this is going to be for folks in the future. When I think of innovation, I think of institutions that have been built that can lead to more long-term changes.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On her journey</span></strong>:<br />
“This was something that I think was lurking around in the background without me noticing it. In my own personal life, I’m the product of public assistance programs. I was raised in the<a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/bronxgunhillhouses.shtml"> Gun Hill Housing Projects</a> in Bronx, New York on Magenta Street. I had<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic"> WIC</a> in my family. It’s something that you don’t really understand until you’re older. Having some of this assistance was critical to my family.”</p>
<p>Rose believes that benefiting from these types of programs helped her stay on track and opened up opportunities like college and interning at the White House where she took further interest in policy, programs, and learning how to take a macro-level concept and “bring it to back to the everyday person through technology.”</p>
<p>She cites three “catalytic”motivators that have accelerated her evolution and pursuit of mRelief:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1 &#8211; <a href="http://chihacknight.org/">Open Government Hack Night at 1871</a></strong>: The founding trio began attending the weekly hack night while they were students at the<a href="http://www.starterleague.com/"> Starter League</a>. “Open Government Hack Night created a space where government people could connect with people like me who are interested in learning how to code, have a policy background and personal experiences that make these problems really relevant &#8211; that made me willing to put my skin in the game, and willing to go hard. The mayor’s office came and stated that this was a problem, and within a week we had built a prototype.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2 &#8211; <a href="http://byp100.org/">Black Youth Project 100:</a></strong> Rose is a National Membership Chair of BYP100, an “activist member-based organization of Black 18-35 year olds, dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people.”  During a retreat brainstorming session on pain points and problem solving, “it was unanimous around the room that the humiliation that people experience through public assistance was one of the biggest issues and challenges. It’s something that stayed with me &#8211; there is pain around having to ask for help and being unsure how to get it.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3 &#8211; Carrying a torch</strong> &#8211; “It’s about carrying a torch. There’s an awesome and robust history of advocates who found a home in social services. I like to consider myself someone who is emerging in that space and really trying to &#8211; through the lens of tech, gender, and policy &#8211; solve these broken parts of the system.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On other disrupters in the public service space</span></strong>:<br />
“I have to say this &#8211; People say government is slow and bureaucratic, but I really love the innovation delivery teams that are thinking through how to problem solve within government. I really think that<a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/"> Bloomberg Philanthropies</a> has knocked it out of the park. And<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"> 18F</a> is hella dope, right? In terms of public benefits eligibility,<a href="https://www.gov.uk/"> the UK</a> knocks my socks off. And<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyfaustino"> Rey Faustino</a> of<a href="https://www.1deg.org/"> One Degree</a> is the real deal.”</p>
<hr />
<p>When asked about what she wants to contribute to the dialogue on minorities and women in tech and entrepreneurship, she keeps it simple,­ “This is for you too.”</p>

<strong><b>Date of Interview</b>: July 2015</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_708" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portrait.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-708" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portrait-300x288.jpg" alt="Julie Schumacher, Well Turned Words" width="300" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Julie Schumacher, <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Julie Schumacher is a writer, teacher, community organizer, mother, wife, traveler. She is the owner of <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a>, her own writing studio, and the co-founder of <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth Chicago</a>, “an organization focused on creating intentional events that celebrate community and connect people.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On going from teacher to writer and business owner:</span></strong><br />
Julie was a teacher for 10 years and fully expected that she would be a teacher for her entire career. She loved teaching; she had tenure; she loved making an impact on her students. “Still, I felt like there were other things that I could do.”</p>
<p>She took an extended maternity leave when she had her daughter and did some work for her husband, an independent web developer. “I was terrible at it.” However, from that, came the idea of Julie using her writing background to help with copy editing for some of her husband’s clients, creative friends, and collaborators. She ended up spending the last few months of her maternity leave creating a portfolio of her writing samples and launched her writing business, <a href="http://wellturnedwords.com/">Well Turned Words</a>.</p>
<p>“I learned that there are really different types of writing and that you can leverage and differentiate yourself with whatever background you have. I am a good facilitator, researcher and community builder.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s been incredible. I still can’t believe I get to be a writer. It’s a total thrill.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On being creative</span></strong>:<br />
“At Forth, we focus on creative entrepreneurs. Does that only mean people who are doing photography, writing or design? &#8211; No. It is more about a mindset and an approach to your work versus the product. You can have a creative approach to how you model your business.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“People in all walks of life who are thoughtfully engaged in how they do their work and how they’re producing are being creative. There are more jobs now that put the word ‘creative’ in front of it &#8211; which opens people up to putting their own stamp on it, doing it in a different way, or thinking about it across disciplines and pursuits.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On building women-centric community:</span></strong><br />
Julie is and has been active in multiple community organizations, many of which are women-centric. Her primary “side hustle” is <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth Chicago</a>, a women-focused organization started in 2012 by three creative and entrepreneurial women.</p>
<p>There’s a part of Julie that feels hesitant about excluding men. “I think guys are great!” But she knows that “the challenges that women face, the work that we do, the way that we do it, and the relationships that come out of it are unique. Discussing that unique space that we occupy as independent creators and entrepreneurs was something that the three of us felt really hungry for, and we’ve learned from the response to Forth that we weren’t the only women who felt that way.”</p>
<p>“There is a special way that women work and interact with one another. The entrepreneur community allows that to flourish. Forth allows me to write and to engage in creative conversation with people doing all types of things. There’s also hugging at Forth. There’s not a lot of hugging in copy writing.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On side-stepping stereotypes and cliches:</span></strong><br />
“It is so interesting to see the way in which the women of <a href="http://forthchicago.com/">Forth</a> collaborate and share resources. So often the public conversation is about women being horrible to each other. I’m excited that more and more I’m seeing people not just fight against those stereotypes, but just side step them completely. It is like they’re saying, ‘ I’m too busy mapping out my destiny and building other women up to have time to prove that I’m disproving the stereotype.’ I love that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Throw your shoulde</strong><strong>rs back, and step into the person that you are.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Julie tries not to engage or over think the “can women have it all?” conversation, but is also mindful that she has a “great partner who is a feminist, who is thoughtful, who believes in me as a person- I’m privileged to be in that position. There is a group of women who are 5-7 years younger and will soon be moving into the space of creative entrepreneurship and parenthood; and I want to lead by example for them.”</p>
<hr />
<p>You can find <a href="http://wemadethisourselves.com/">Julie and her family</a> taking their summer working sabbatical this year in Christchurch, New Zealand. One of her fondest book experiences is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitterbug_Perfume">Jitterbug Perfume</a> by Tom Robbins, partly due to this resonating quote: “Perhaps the most terrible (or wonderful) thing that can happen to an imaginative youth, aside from the curse (or blessing) of imagination itself, is to be exposed without preparation to the life outside his or her own sphere &#8211; the sudden revelation that there is a there out there.”</p>

<b>Company Site</b>: <a href="http://levibaer.com/">Levibaer.com</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryBaer">Twitter</a>; <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">Coffee &amp; Conversation</a><br />
<b>Date of Interview</b>: July 2015</p>
<div id="attachment_690" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/levi-baer.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-690" src="http://belikepeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/levi-baer-300x300.jpg" alt="Levi Baer" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://levibaer.com/">Levi Baer </a><br />Art by <a href="http://www.francescodibattista.com/">Francesco DiBattista</a></p></div>
<p>Levi Baer is a community builder, a team facilitator, an organizational change strategist, and was previously a nationally ranked <a href="http://www.catan.com/">Settlers of Catan</a> player. He believes in using studied theories and real-life experiences to uncover the powers of effective team building, engagement, and collaboration. He is currently the community manager at <a href="http://workshopchicago.co/">Workshop Chicago</a>; leads the Chicago communities, <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">Coffee &amp; Conversation</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GameNightChicago/"> Game Night Chicago</a>; and runs his own <a href="http://levibaer.com/">consultancy</a>. His favorite superhero is Spiderman, and his current favorite board game is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84876/castles-burgundy">The Castles of Burgundy</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On creating an organic community, Coffee &amp; Conversation</b></span>:<br />
The origins of <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">Coffee &amp; Conversation</a> are pretty simple. Levi sent out a call for other people to join him on Saturday mornings for some productivity. He wasn’t looking to focus the group on entrepreneurship, but there was a natural overlap. What started as a casual Saturday morning meetup has turned into a group of regulars and newcomers sharing ideas and collaborating on projects and businesses.</p>
<p>“If you keep providing the opportunities, then there will be people that show up every time. If there’s alignment of values, common interests, and take aways, then the community will be built around that. When you do that regularly and consistently, people start to show up every time.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t&#8217; have a space, we didn&#8217;t have a name &#8211;  just people showing up.&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>
<p>In the year that Coffee &amp; Conversation (“C&amp;C”) has been around, they’ve already seen the positive output of like-minded people collaborating across unlikely spaces. For example, two C&amp;C members were able to help each other by combining their expertise in immigration services and language study. As a result, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mlangschool">Mobile Language School</a> created a class that combined language learning with cultural food experiences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On community-building in organizations</b></span>:<br />
So how do you take the concepts and results experienced in unstructured organic environments and apply them to structured hierarchies of organizations?</p>
<p>“The importance of building a community in an organization is a big question. It is about applying the values of collaboration and face to face communication. We need to push the boundaries of traditional work spaces where there is usually a competitive work environment of trying to get promotions and recognition that translates into, ‘I need to do better than the person next to me.’ Community building turns that on its head and makes you think about what you can do if resources are unabashedly being shared and if people aren’t afraid of giving up their ideas to the greater good of the group.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Community building creates happy, productive, effective spaces. It improves effectiveness, retention and in turn, the bottom line&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Levi applies his formal and informal education to produce products and frameworks which he uses in client and consulting settings. For example, Insight is a card game that he invented to facilitate team building, interaction and idea sharing. He is currently working on refining an additional product derived from his more recent community-based research with C&amp;C.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“Community and collaboration is a big challenge. But I think it is surmountable by organizations who are interested in doing so.”</b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>On effective communication</b></span>:<br />
Effective collaboration and teaming relies heavily on effective communication. “I’m not alone in being sick of emails. They’re so inefficient. It’s about discovering and boosting other methods of communication that are out there and trying to have a more real and genuine interaction. Whatever one you’re using, just make it the best. You can make anything meaningful on any platform.”</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“Look for a tool that facilitates interaction while letting individuals pick their own level of engagement.”</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong>One of his current favorites is <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside of his community projects and consulting development, Levi tries to live each moment with intention. &#8220;I do everything with intention, for both the big and small choices in my life. I put a lot of thought into all of it. It&#8217;s the small things you do and how you act when nobody is looking that defines you.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can find him every other Saturday morning with <a href="http://coffeeandconversation.info/">C&amp;C</a> and every other Wednesday night at<a title="Game Night Chicago" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GameNightChicago/"> Game Night Chicago</a>.</p>

<p><i>“You just need to be consuming all the time. If you don’t have an appetite for continuing to grow and learning all the tools that are making businesses better, then it’s going to be hard to survive. If you really find a project that you are passionate about, I think the appetite will develop because you really want to impact that area and see your brain child grow. If it’s not there, then you’re probably not passionate enough about that issue or subject. The passion drives that appetite. If you don’t feel it, you might be misaligned about what you think you’re passionate about.” &#8211; <a title="Riana Lynn, FoodTrace" href="http://belikepeter.com/riana-lynn-food-trace/">Rianna Lynn, FoodTrace</a></i></p>
<p><em>&#8220;What gets me excited is that I can get to a certain point where I have increased my network with the leaders of the world and society, and can create something much larger. I just want to challenge the norm of what people do. I want to create a new way of investing in people – especially those who don’t have the opportunity that I had.&#8221; &#8211; <a title="Dan Novaes, MobileX Labs" href="http://belikepeter.com/dan-novaes-mobilex-labs/">Dan Novaes, MobileX Labs</a></em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t think everyone has to be gluten-free necessarily. People find different things that work for their bodies. I do think that people do better when they eat less sugar and less processed foods. Many times, gluten is accompanied by processed foods and refined sugar. It’s better to say you’re going to eat a diet of simple natural ingredients versus to just be gluten-free.” &#8211; <a title="Katlin Smith, Simple Mills" href="http://belikepeter.com/katlin-smith-simple-mills/">Katlin Smith, Simple Mills</a></em></p>
